**Abstract:**
Neurofeedback is a kind of biofeedback, which teaches self-control of brain functions to subjects by measuring brain waves and providing a feedback signal. Neurofeedback usually provides the audio and or video feedback. Positive or negative feedback is produced for desirable or undesirable brain activities, respectively. In this review, we provided clinical and technical information about the following issues: (1) Various neurofeedback treatment protocols i.e. alpha, beta, alpha/theta, delta, gamma, and theta; (2) Different EEG electrode placements i.e. standard recording channels in the frontal, temporal, central, and occipital lobes; (3) Electrode montages (unipolar, bipolar); (4) Types of neurofeedback i.e. frequency, power, slow cortical potential, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and so on; (5) Clinical applications of neurofeedback i.e. treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, epilepsy, insomnia, drug addiction, schizophrenia, learning disabilities, dyslexia and dyscalculia, autistic spectrum disorders and so on as well as other applications such as pain management, and the improvement of musical and athletic performance; and (6) Neurofeedback softwares. To date, many studies have been conducted on the neurofeedback therapy and its effectiveness on the treatment of many diseases. Neurofeedback, like other treatments, has its own pros and cons. Although it is a non-invasive procedure, its validity has been questioned in terms of conclusive scientific evidence. For example, it is expensive, time-consuming and its benefits are not long-lasting. Also, it might take months to show the desired improvements. Nevertheless, neurofeedback is known as a complementary and alternative treatment of many brain dysfunctions. However, current research does not support conclusive results about its efficacy.

**Abstract:**
Neurofeedback is attracting renewed interest as a method to self-regulate one's own brain activity to directly alter the underlying neural mechanisms of cognition and behavior. It not only promises new avenues as a method for cognitive enhancement in healthy subjects, but also as a therapeutic tool. In the current article, we present a review tutorial discussing key aspects relevant to the development of electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback studies. In addition, the putative mechanisms underlying neurofeedback learning are considered. We highlight both aspects relevant for the practical application of neurofeedback as well as rather theoretical considerations related to the development of new generation protocols. Important characteristics regarding the set-up of a neurofeedback protocol are outlined in a step-by-step way. All these practical and theoretical considerations are illustrated based on a protocol and results of a frontal-midline theta up-regulation training for the improvement of executive functions. Not least, assessment criteria for the validation of neurofeedback studies as well as general guidelines for the evaluation of training efficacy are discussed.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability among adults and contributes to major socio-economic burden globally. Stroke frequently results in multifaceted impairments including motor, cognitive and emotion deficits. In recent years, brain–computer interface (BCI)-based therapy has shown promising results for post-stroke motor rehabilitation. In spite of the success received by BCI-based interventions in the motor domain, non-motor impairments are yet to receive similar attention in research and clinical settings. Some preliminary encouraging results in post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation using BCI seem to suggest that it may also hold potential for treating non-motor deficits such as cognitive and emotion impairments. Moreover, past studies have shown an intricate relationship between motor, cognitive and emotion functions which might influence the overall post-stroke rehabilitation outcome. A number of studies highlight the inability of current treatment protocols to account for the implicit interplay between motor, cognitive and emotion functions. This indicates the necessity to explore an all-inclusive treatment plan targeting the synergistic influence of these standalone interventions. This approach may lead to better overall recovery than treating the individual deficits in isolation. In this paper, we review the recent advances in BCI-based post-stroke motor rehabilitation and highlight the potential for the use of BCI systems beyond the motor domain, in particular, in improving cognition and emotion of stroke patients. Building on the current results and findings of studies in individual domains, we next discuss the possibility of a holistic BCI system for motor, cognitive and affect rehabilitation which may synergistically promote restorative neuroplasticity. Such a system would provide an all-encompassing rehabilitation platform, leading to overarching clinical outcomes and transfer of these outcomes to a better quality of living. This is one of the first works to analyse the possibility of targeting cross-domain influence of post-stroke functional recovery enabled by BCI-based rehabilitation.

**Abstract:**
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a persistent neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of children and adolescents and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Throughout an individual's lifetime, ADHD can increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders, educational and occupational failure, accidents, criminality, social disability and addictions. No single risk factor is necessary or sufficient to cause ADHD. In most cases ADHD arises from several genetic and environmental risk factors that each have a small individual effect and act together to increase susceptibility. The multifactorial causation of ADHD is consistent with the heterogeneity of the disorder, which is shown by its extensive psychiatric co-morbidity, its multiple domains of neurocognitive impairment and the wide range of structural and functional brain anomalies associated with it. The diagnosis of ADHD is reliable and valid when evaluated with standard criteria for psychiatric disorders. Rating scales and clinical interviews facilitate diagnosis and aid screening. The expression of symptoms varies as a function of patient developmental stage and social and academic contexts. Although there are no curative treatments for ADHD, evidenced-based treatments can markedly reduce its symptoms and associated impairments. For example, medications are efficacious and normally well tolerated, and various non-pharmacological approaches are also valuable. Ongoing clinical and neurobiological research holds the promise of advancing diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to ADHD.

## 5. A Critical Review of Consumer Wearables, Mobile Applications, and Equipment for Providing Biofeedback, Monitoring Stress, and Sleep in Physically Active Populations

- **Authors:** Jonathan M. Peake, Graham Kerr, John P. Sullivan

- **DOI:** 10.3389/fphys.2018.00743

- **Journal:** Frontiers in Physiology

**Abstract:**
The commercial market for technologies to monitor and improve personal health and sports performance is ever expanding. A wide range of smart watches, bands, garments, and patches with embedded sensors, small portable devices and mobile applications now exist to record and provide users with feedback on many different physical performance variables. These variables include cardiorespiratory function, movement patterns, sweat analysis, tissue oxygenation, sleep, emotional state, and changes in cognitive function following concussion. In this review, we have summarized the features and evaluated the characteristics of a cross-section of technologies for health and sports performance according to what the technology is claimed to do, whether it has been validated and is reliable, and if it is suitable for general consumer use. Consumers who are choosing new technology should consider whether it (1) produces desirable (or non-desirable) outcomes, (2) has been developed based on real-world need, and (3) has been tested and proven effective in applied studies in different settings. Among the technologies included in this review, more than half have not been validated through independent research. Only 5% of the technologies have been formally validated. Around 10% of technologies have been developed for and used in research. The value of such technologies for consumer use is debatable, however, because they may require extra time to set up and interpret the data they produce. Looking to the future, the rapidly expanding market of health and sports performance technology has much to offer consumers. To create a competitive advantage, companies producing health and performance technologies should consult with consumers to identify real-world need, and invest in research to prove the effectiveness of their products. To get the best value, consumers should carefully select such products, not only based on their personal needs, but also according to the strength of supporting evidence and effectiveness of the products.

## 7. The Role of Neural Plasticity in Depression: From Hippocampus to Prefrontal Cortex

- **Authors:** Wei Liu, Tongtong Ge, Yashu Leng, Zhenxiang Pan, Jie Fan et al.
- **Year:** 2017
- **DOI:** 10.1155/2017/6871089
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 616
- **Journal:** Neural Plasticity

**Abstract:**
Neural plasticity, a fundamental mechanism of neuronal adaptation, is disrupted in depression. The changes in neural plasticity induced by stress and other negative stimuli play a significant role in the onset and development of depression. Antidepressant treatments have also been found to exert their antidepressant effects through regulatory effects on neural plasticity. However, the detailed mechanisms of neural plasticity in depression still remain unclear. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the recent literature to elaborate the possible mechanistic role of neural plasticity in depression. Taken together, these findings may pave the way for future progress in neural plasticity studies.

- **Authors:** Pablo Martínez, Hovagim Bakardjian, Andrzej Cichocki
- **Year:** 2007
- **DOI:** 10.1155/2007/94561
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 206
- **Journal:** Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience

**Abstract:**
We propose a new multistage procedure for a real-time brain-machine/computer interface (BCI). The developed system allows a BCI user to navigate a small car (or any other object) on the computer screen in real time, in any of the four directions, and to stop it if necessary. Extensive experiments with five young healthy subjects confirmed the high performance of the proposed online BCI system. The modular structure, high speed, and the optimal frequency band characteristics of the BCI platform are features which allow an extension to a substantially higher number of commands in the near future.

- **Citations:** 114
- **Journal:** Neurophotonics

**Abstract:**
We provide a brief overview of the research and clinical applications of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in the neurorehabilitation field. NIRS has several potential advantages and shortcomings as a neuroimaging tool and is suitable for research application in the rehabilitation field. As one of the main applications of NIRS, we discuss its application as a monitoring tool, including investigating the neural mechanism of functional recovery after brain damage and investigating the neural mechanisms for controlling bipedal locomotion and postural balance in humans. In addition to being a monitoring tool, advances in signal processing techniques allow us to use NIRS as a therapeutic tool in this field. With a brief summary of recent studies investigating the clinical application of NIRS using motor imagery task, we discuss the possible clinical usage of NIRS in brain-computer interface and neurofeedback.

## 10. Hippocampal Non-Theta-Contingent Eyeblink Classical Conditioning: A Model System for Neurobiological Dysfunction

- **Authors:** Joseph J. Cicchese, Stephen D. Berry
- **Year:** 2016
- **DOI:** 10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00001
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 174
- **Journal:** Frontiers in Psychiatry

**Abstract:**
Typical information processing is thought to depend on the integrity of neurobiological oscillations that may underlie coordination and timing of cells and assemblies within and between structures. The 3-7 Hz bandwidth of hippocampal theta rhythm is associated with cognitive processes essential to learning and depends on the integrity of cholinergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic forebrain systems. Since several significant psychiatric disorders appear to result from dysfunction of medial temporal lobe (MTL) neurochemical systems, preclinical studies on animal models may be an important step in defining and treating such syndromes. Many studies have shown that the amount of hippocampal theta in the rabbit strongly predicts the acquisition rate of classical eyeblink conditioning and that impairment of this system substantially slows the rate of learning and attainment of asymptotic performance. Our lab has developed a brain-computer interface that makes eyeblink training trials contingent upon the explicit presence or absence of hippocampal theta. The behavioral benefit of theta-contingent training has been demonstrated in both delay and trace forms of the paradigm with a two- to fourfold increase in learning speed over non-theta states. The non-theta behavioral impairment is accompanied by disruption of the amplitude and synchrony of hippocampal local field potentials, multiple-unit excitation, and single-unit response patterns dependent on theta state. Our findings indicate a significant electrophysiological and behavioral impact of the pretrial state of the hippocampus that suggests an important role for this MTL system in associative learning and a significant deleterious impact in the absence of theta. Here, we focus on the impairments in the non-theta state, integrate them into current models of psychiatric disorders, and suggest how improvement in our understanding of neurobiological oscillations is critical for theories and treatment of psychiatric pathology.

## 12. Neurotechnologies for Human Cognitive Augmentation: Current State of the Art and Future Prospects

- **Authors:** Caterina Cinel, Davide Valeriani, Riccardo Poli
- **Year:** 2019
- **DOI:** 10.3389/fnhum.2019.00013
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 162
- **Journal:** Frontiers in Human Neuroscience

**Abstract:**
Recent advances in neuroscience have paved the way to innovative applications that cognitively augment and enhance humans in a variety of contexts. This paper aims at providing a snapshot of the current state of the art and a motivated forecast of the most likely developments in the next two decades. Firstly, we survey the main neuroscience technologies for both observing and influencing brain activity, which are necessary ingredients for human cognitive augmentation. We also compare and contrast such technologies, as their individual characteristics (e.g., spatio-temporal resolution, invasiveness, portability, energy requirements, and cost) influence their current and future role in human cognitive augmentation. Secondly, we chart the state of the art on neurotechnologies for human cognitive augmentation, keeping an eye both on the applications that already exist and those that are emerging or are likely to emerge in the next two decades. Particularly, we consider applications in the areas of communication, cognitive enhancement, memory, attention monitoring/enhancement, situation awareness and complex problem solving, and we look at what fraction of the population might benefit from such technologies and at the demands they impose in terms of user training. Thirdly, we briefly review the ethical issues associated with current neuroscience technologies. These are important because they may differentially influence both present and future research on (and adoption of) neurotechnologies for human cognitive augmentation: an inferior technology with no significant ethical issues may thrive while a superior technology causing widespread ethical concerns may end up being outlawed. Finally, based on the lessons learned in our analysis, using past trends and considering other related forecasts, we attempt to forecast the most likely future developments of neuroscience technology for human cognitive augmentation and provide informed recommendations for promising future research and exploitation avenues.

- **Authors:** Muyue Yang, Zhen Yang, Ti‐Fei Yuan, Wuwei Feng, Pu Wang
- **Year:** 2019
- **DOI:** 10.3389/fneur.2019.00058
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 127
- **Journal:** Frontiers in Neurology

**Abstract:**
<b>Background:</b> Survivors of stroke often experience significant disability and impaired quality of life. The recovery of motor or cognitive function requires long periods. Neuroimaging could measure changes in the brain and monitor recovery process in order to offer timely treatment and assess the effects of therapy. A non-invasive neuroimaging technique near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with its ambulatory, portable, low-cost nature without fixation of subjects has attracted extensive attention. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a comprehensive literature review in order to review the use of NIRS in stroke or post-stroke patients in July 2018. NCBI Pubmed database, EMBASE database, Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect database were searched. <b>Results:</b> Overall, we reviewed 66 papers. NIRS has a wide range of application, including in monitoring upper limb, lower limb recovery, motor learning, cortical function recovery, cerebral hemodynamic changes, cerebral oxygenation, as well as in therapeutic method, clinical researches, and evaluation of the risk for stroke. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study provides a preliminary evidence of the application of NIRS in stroke patients as a monitoring, therapeutic, and research tool. Further studies could give more emphasize on the combination of NIRS with other techniques and its utility in the prevention of stroke.

- **Journal:** International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy (iJEP)

**Abstract:**
The research area of brain plasticity studies indicates that individuals can train and improve their cognitive abilities throughout life. In addition, more and more computerized training tools are presented in recent studies. The purpose of this study is to represent studies of the last decade in the field of cognitive training with the use of Information and Communication Tech-nologies, to record the cognitive improvement techniques used, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of these intervention programs. As indicated by the literature review, computer-based tools, mobile training apps and video games could be used in intervention studies for cognitive improve-ment. In addition, cognitive training techniques seem to be significantly ef-fective for the cognitive improvement of healthy or cognitive impaired in-dividuals.

## 16. Virtual Reality for Neurorehabilitation and Cognitive Enhancement

- **Authors:** Данко Георгиев, Iva Georgieva, Zhengya Gong, Vijayakumar Nanjappan, Georgi V. Georgiev
- **Year:** 2021
- **DOI:** 10.3390/brainsci11020221
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 151
- **Journal:** Brain Sciences

**Abstract:**
Our access to computer-generated worlds changes the way we feel, how we think, and how we solve problems. In this review, we explore the utility of different types of virtual reality, immersive or non-immersive, for providing controllable, safe environments that enable individual training, neurorehabilitation, or even replacement of lost functions. The neurobiological effects of virtual reality on neuronal plasticity have been shown to result in increased cortical gray matter volumes, higher concentration of electroencephalographic beta-waves, and enhanced cognitive performance. Clinical application of virtual reality is aided by innovative brain–computer interfaces, which allow direct tapping into the electric activity generated by different brain cortical areas for precise voluntary control of connected robotic devices. Virtual reality is also valuable to healthy individuals as a narrative medium for redesigning their individual stories in an integrative process of self-improvement and personal development. Future upgrades of virtual reality-based technologies promise to help humans transcend the limitations of their biological bodies and augment their capacity to mold physical reality to better meet the needs of a globalized world.

## 17. Brain enhancement through cognitive training: a new insight from brain connectome

- **Authors:** Fumihiko Taya, Yu Sun, Fabio Babiloni, Nitish V. Thakor, Anastasios Bezerianos
- **Year:** 2015
- **DOI:** 10.3389/fnsys.2015.00044
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 97
- **Journal:** Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience

**Abstract:**
Owing to the recent advances in neurotechnology and the progress in understanding of brain cognitive functions, improvements of cognitive performance or acceleration of learning process with brain enhancement systems is not out of our reach anymore, on the contrary, it is a tangible target of contemporary research. Although a variety of approaches have been proposed, we will mainly focus on cognitive training interventions, in which learners repeatedly perform cognitive tasks to improve their cognitive abilities. In this review article, we propose that the learning process during the cognitive training can be facilitated by an assistive system monitoring cognitive workloads using electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers, and the brain connectome approach can provide additional valuable biomarkers for facilitating leaners' learning processes. For the purpose, we will introduce studies on the cognitive training interventions, EEG biomarkers for cognitive workload, and human brain connectome. As cognitive overload and mental fatigue would reduce or even eliminate gains of cognitive training interventions, a real-time monitoring of cognitive workload can facilitate the learning process by flexibly adjusting difficulty levels of the training task. Moreover, cognitive training interventions should have effects on brain sub-networks, not on a single brain region, and graph theoretical network metrics quantifying topological architecture of the brain network can differentiate with respect to individual cognitive states as well as to different individuals' cognitive abilities, suggesting that the connectome is a valuable approach for tracking the learning progress. Although only a few studies have exploited the connectome approach for studying alterations of the brain network induced by cognitive training interventions so far, we believe that it would be a useful technique for capturing improvements of cognitive functions.

## 18. Neuroplastic Effects of Combined Computerized Physical and Cognitive Training in Elderly Individuals at Risk for Dementia: An eLORETA Controlled Study on Resting States

- **Authors:** Charis Styliadis, Panagiotis Kartsidis, Evangelos Paraskevopoulos, Andreas A. Ioannides, Panagiotis D. Bamidis
- **Year:** 2015
- **DOI:** 10.1155/2015/172192
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 109
- **Journal:** Neural Plasticity

**Abstract:**
The present study investigates whether a combined cognitive and physical training may induce changes in the cortical activity as measured via electroencephalogram (EEG) and whether this change may index a deceleration of pathological processes of brain aging. Seventy seniors meeting the clinical criteria of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were equally divided into 5 groups: 3 experimental groups engaged in eight-week cognitive and/or physical training and 2 control groups: active and passive. A 5-minute long resting state EEG was measured before and after the intervention. Cortical EEG sources were modelled by exact low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). Cognitive function was assessed before and after intervention using a battery of neuropsychological tests including the minimental state examination (MMSE). A significant training effect was identified only after the combined training scheme: a decrease in the post- compared to pre-training activity of precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex in delta, theta, and beta bands. This effect was correlated to improvements in cognitive capacity as evaluated by MMSE scores. Our results indicate that combined physical and cognitive training shows indices of a positive neuroplastic effect in MCI patients and that EEG may serve as a potential index of gains versus cognitive declines and neurodegeneration. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT02313935 .

- **Journal:** Frontiers in Human Neuroscience

**Abstract:**
Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) is an index utilized to indicate coherence between brain motor cortex and associated body muscles, conventionally. As an index of functional connections between the cortex and muscles, CMC research is the focus of neurophysiology in recent years. Although CMC has been extensively studied in healthy subjects and sports disorders, the purpose of its applications is still ambiguous, and the magnitude of CMC varies among individuals. Here, we aim to investigate factors that modulate the variation of CMC amplitude and compare significant CMC between these factors to find a well-developed research prospect. In the present review, we discuss the mechanism of CMC and propose a general definition of CMC. Factors affecting CMC are also summarized as follows: experimental design, band frequencies and force levels, age correlation, and difference between healthy controls and patients. In addition, we provide a detailed overview of the current CMC applications for various motor disorders. Further recognition of the factors affecting CMC amplitude can clarify the physiological mechanism and is beneficial to the implementation of CMC clinical methods.

## 20. Tuning Up the Old Brain with New Tricks: Attention Training via Neurofeedback

- **Authors:** Yang Jiang, Reza Abiri, Xiaopeng Zhao
- **Year:** 2017
- **DOI:** 10.3389/fnagi.2017.00052
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 69
- **Journal:** Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience

**Abstract:**
Neurofeedback (NF) is a form of biofeedback that uses real-time (RT) modulation of brain activity to enhance brain function and behavioral performance. Recent advances in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) and cognitive training (CT) have provided new tools and evidence that NF improves cognitive functions, such as attention and working memory (WM), beyond what is provided by traditional CT. More published studies have demonstrated the efficacy of NF, particularly for treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. In contrast, there have been fewer studies done in older adults with or without cognitive impairment, with some notable exceptions. The focus of this review is to summarize current success in RT NF training of older brains aiming to match those of younger brains during attention/WM tasks. We also outline potential future advances in RT brainwave-based NF for improving attention training in older populations. The rapid growth in wireless recording of brain activity, machine learning classification and brain network analysis provides new tools for combating cognitive decline and brain aging in older adults. We optimistically conclude that NF, combined with new neuro-markers (event-related potentials and connectivity) and traditional features, promises to provide new hope for brain and CT in the growing older population.

## 21. Why Brain Criticality Is Clinically Relevant: A Scoping Review

- **Authors:** Vincent Zimmern
- **Year:** 2020
- **DOI:** 10.3389/fncir.2020.00054
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 185
- **Journal:** Frontiers in Neural Circuits

**Abstract:**
The past 25 years have seen a strong increase in the number of publications related to criticality in different areas of neuroscience. The potential of criticality to explain various brain properties, including optimal information processing, has made it an increasingly exciting area of investigation for neuroscientists. Recent reviews on this topic, sometimes termed brain criticality, make brief mention of clinical applications of these findings to several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and neonatal hypoxia. Other clinicallyrelevant domains - including anesthesia, sleep medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and psychiatry - are seldom discussed in review papers of brain criticality. Thorough assessments of these application areas and their relevance for clinicians have also yet to be published. In this scoping review, studies of brain criticality involving human data of all ages are evaluated for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results of these studies understandable to a more clinical audience, a review of the key concepts behind criticality (e.g., phase transitions, long-range temporal correlation, self-organized criticality, power laws, branching processes) precedes the discussion of human clinical studies. Open questions and forthcoming areas of investigation are also considered.

**Abstract:**
With the continuous development of artificial intelligence technology, “brain‐computer interfaces” are gradually entering the field of medical rehabilitation. As a result, brain‐computer interfaces (BCIs) have been included in many countries’ strategic plans for innovating this field, and subsequently, major funding and talent have been invested in this technology. In neurological rehabilitation for stroke patients, the use of BCIs opens up a new chapter in “top‐down” rehabilitation. In our study, we first reviewed the latest BCI technologies, then presented recent research advances and landmark findings in BCI‐based neurorehabilitation for stroke patients. Neurorehabilitation was focused on the areas of motor, sensory, speech, cognitive, and environmental interactions. Finally, we summarized the shortcomings of BCI use in the field of stroke neurorehabilitation and the prospects for BCI technology development for rehabilitation.

- **DOI:** 10.5607/en.2013.22.3.173
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 132
- **Journal:** Experimental Neurobiology

**Abstract:**
Our survival and wellness require a balance between optimism and pessimism. Undue pessimism makes life miserable; however, excessive optimism can lead to dangerously risky behaviors. A review and synthesis of the literature on the neurophysiology subserving these two worldviews suggests that optimism and pessimism are differentially associated with the two cerebral hemispheres. High self-esteem, a cheerful attitude that tends to look at the positive aspects of a given situation, as well as an optimistic belief in a bright future are associated with physiological activity in the left-hemisphere (LH). In contrast, a gloomy viewpoint, an inclination to focus on the negative part and exaggerate its significance, low self-esteem as well as a pessimistic view on what the future holds are interlinked with neurophysiological processes in the right-hemisphere (RH). This hemispheric asymmetry in mediating optimistic and pessimistic outlooks is rooted in several biological and functional differences between the two hemispheres. The RH mediation of a watchful and inhibitive mode weaves a sense of insecurity that generates and supports pessimistic thought patterns. Conversely, the LH mediation of an active mode and the positive feedback it receives through its motor dexterity breed a sense of confidence in one's ability to manage life's challenges, and optimism about the future.

**Abstract:**
The increasing miniaturization and affordability of sensors and circuitry has led to the current level of innovation in the area of wearable and microsensor solutions for health monitoring. This facilitates the development of solutions that can be used to measure complex health outcomes in nonspecialist and remote settings. In this article, we review a number of innovations related to brain monitoring including portable and wearable solutions to directly measure brain electrical activity, and solutions measuring aspects related to brain function such as sleep patterns, gait, cognition, voice acoustics, and gaze analysis. Despite the need for more scientific validation work, we conclude that there is enough understanding of how to implement these approaches as exploratory tools that may provide additional valuable insights due to the rich and frequent data they produce, to justify their inclusion in clinical study protocols.

**Abstract:**
The advent of dedicated Deep Learning (DL) accelerators and neuromorphic processors has brought on new opportunities for applying both Deep and Spiking Neural Network (SNN) algorithms to healthcare and biomedical applications at the edge. This can facilitate the advancement of medical Internet of Things (IoT) systems and Point of Care (PoC) devices. In this paper, we provide a tutorial describing how various technologies including emerging memristive devices, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) can be used to develop efficient DL accelerators to solve a wide variety of diagnostic, pattern recognition, and signal processing problems in healthcare. Furthermore, we explore how spiking neuromorphic processors can complement their DL counterparts for processing biomedical signals. The tutorial is augmented with case studies of the vast literature on neural network and neuromorphic hardware as applied to the healthcare domain. We benchmark various hardware platforms by performing a sensor fusion signal processing task combining electromyography (EMG) signals with computer vision. Comparisons are made between dedicated neuromorphic processors and embedded AI accelerators in terms of inference latency and energy. Finally, we provide our analysis of the field and share a perspective on the advantages, disadvantages, challenges, and opportunities that various accelerators and neuromorphic processors introduce to healthcare and biomedical domains.

**Abstract:**
There is a growing body of evidence that important aspects of human cognition have been marginalized, or overlooked, by traditional cognitive science. In particular, the use of laboratory-based experiments in which stimuli are artificial, and response options are fixed, inevitably results in findings that are less ecologically valid in relation to real-world behavior. In the present review we highlight the opportunities provided by a range of new mobile technologies that allow traditionally lab-bound measurements to now be collected during natural interactions with the world. We begin by outlining the theoretical support that mobile approaches receive from the development of embodied accounts of cognition, and we review the widening evidence that illustrates the importance of examining cognitive processes in their context. As we acknowledge, in practice, the development of mobile approaches brings with it fresh challenges, and will undoubtedly require innovation in paradigm design and analysis. If successful, however, the mobile cognition approach will offer novel insights in a range of areas, including understanding the cognitive processes underlying navigation through space and the role of attention during natural behavior. We argue that the development of real-world mobile cognition offers both increased ecological validity, and the opportunity to examine the interactions between perception, cognition and action-rather than examining each in isolation.

## 30. A closed-loop, music-based brain-computer interface for emotion mediation

**Abstract:**
Emotions play a critical role in rational and intelligent behavior; a better fundamental knowledge of them is indispensable for understanding higher order brain function. We propose a non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) system to feedback a person's affective state such that a closed-loop interaction between the participant's brain responses and the musical stimuli is established. We realized this concept technically in a functional prototype of an algorithm that generates continuous and controllable patterns of synthesized affective music in real-time, which is embedded within a BCI architecture. We evaluated our concept in two separate studies. In the first study, we tested the efficacy of our music algorithm by measuring subjective affective responses from 11 participants. In a second pilot study, the algorithm was embedded in a real-time BCI architecture to investigate affective closed-loop interactions in 5 participants. Preliminary results suggested that participants were able to intentionally modulate the musical feedback by self-inducing emotions (e.g., by recalling memories), suggesting that the system was able not only to capture the listener's current affective state in real-time, but also potentially provide a tool for listeners to mediate their own emotions by interacting with music. The proposed concept offers a tool to study emotions in the loop, promising to cast a complementary light on emotion-related brain research, particularly in terms of clarifying the interactive, spatio-temporal dynamics underlying affective processing in the brain.

## 31. Distinct EEG effects related to neurofeedback training in children with ADHD: a randomized controlled trial.

**Abstract:**
In a randomized controlled trial, neurofeedback (NF) training was found to be superior to a computerised attention skills training concerning the reduction of ADHD symptomatology (Gevensleben et al., 2009). The aims of this investigation were to assess the impact of different NF protocols (theta/beta training and training of slow cortical potentials, SCPs) on the resting EEG and the association between distinct EEG measures and behavioral improvements. In 72 (of initially 102) children with ADHD, aged 8-12, EEG changes after either a NF training (n=46) or the control training (n=26) could be studied. The combined NF training consisted of one block of theta/beta training and one block of SCP training, each block comprising 18 units of 50 minutes (balanced order). Spontaneous EEG was recorded in a two-minute resting condition before the start of the training, between the two training blocks and after the end of the training. Activity in the different EEG frequency bands was analyzed. In contrast to the control condition, the combined NF training was accompanied by a reduction of theta activity. Protocol-specific EEG changes (theta/beta training: decrease of posterior-midline theta activity; SCP training: increase of central-midline alpha activity) were associated with improvements in the German ADHD rating scale. Related EEG-based predictors were obtained. Thus, differential EEG patterns for theta/beta and SCP training provide further evidence that distinct neuronal mechanisms may contribute to similar behavioral improvements in children with ADHD.

**Abstract:**
Persistent musculoskeletal pain is associated with altered functional and effective connectivity (EC) between cortical regions involved in pain processing. Especially, disruptions in the infraslow fluctuation (ISF) frequency band can contribute to pain persistence. ISF electroencephalography-neurofeedback (EEG-NF) has emerged as a potential non-invasive neuromodulatory intervention targeting cortical brain regions to restore balance and modulate pain-related pathways. However, limited research explores its effect on EC, a measure of directional information flow critical to pain experience and modulation.
