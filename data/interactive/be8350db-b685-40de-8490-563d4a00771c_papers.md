**Abstract:**
Engaging users is a priority for designers of products and services of every kind. The need to understand users’ experiences has motivated a focus on user engagement across computer science. However, to date, there has been limited review of how Human--Computer Interaction and computer science research interprets and employs the concept. Questions persist concerning its conception, abstraction, and measurement. This article presents a systematic review of engagement spanning a corpus of 351 articles and 102 definitions. We map the current state of engagement research, including the diverse interpretation, theory, and measurement of the concept. We describe the ecology of engagement and strategies for the design of engaging experiences, discuss the value of the concept and its relationship to other terms, and present a set of guidelines and opportunities for future research.

**Abstract:**
Inactivity and a lack of engagement with exercise is a pressing health problem in the United States and beyond. Immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) is a promising medium to motivate users through engaging virtual environments. Currently, modern iVR lacks a comparative analysis between research and consumer-grade systems for exercise and health. This article examines two such iVR mediums: the Cave Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE) and the head-mounted display (HMD). Specifically, we compare the room-scale Mechdyne CAVE and HTC Vive Pro HMD with a custom in-house exercise game that was designed such that user experiences were as consistent as possible between both systems. To ensure that our findings are generalizable for users of varying abilities, we recruited 40 participants with and without cognitive disabilities with regard to the fact that iVR environments and games can differ in their cognitive challenge between users. Our results show that across all abilities, the HMD excelled in in-game performance, biofeedback response, and player engagement. We conclude with considerations in utilizing iVR systems for exergaming with users across cognitive abilities.

**Abstract:**
Technology research for neurodivergent conditions is largely shaped by research aims which privilege neuro-normative outcomes. As such, there is an epistemic imbalance in meaning making about these technologies. We conducted a critical literature review of technologies designed for people with ADHD, focusing on how ADHD is framed, the research aims and approaches, the role of people with ADHD within the research process, and the types of systems being developed within Computing and HCI. Our analysis and review is conducted explicitly from an insider perspective, bringing our perspectives as neurodivergent researchers to the topic of technologies in the context of ADHD. We found that 1) technologies are largely used to ‘mitigate’ the experiences of ADHD which are perceived as disruptive to neurotypical standards of behaviour; 2) little HCI research in the area invites this population to co-construct the technologies or to leverage neurodivergent experiences in the construction of research aims; and 3) participant resistance to deficit frames can be read within the researchers’ own accounts of participant actions. We discuss the implications of this status quo for disabled people and technology researchers alike, and close with a set of recommendations for future work in this area.

**Abstract:**
Post-stroke therapy restores lost skills. Traditionally, patients are supported by skilled therapists who monitor their progress and evaluate the program's effectiveness. Due to a shortage of qualified therapists, rehabilitation facilities are both expensive and inadequate. Furthermore, evaluations may be subjective and prone to errors. These limitations motivate the researchers to devise automated systems with minimal human intervention, therapist-like assessment, and broader outreach. This article reviews seminal works from 2013 onwards, qualitatively and quantitatively adapting the PRISMA approach to examine the potential of robot-assisted, virtual reality-based rehabilitation and automated assessments through data-driven learning. Extensive experimentation on KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets reveal high agreement between automated methods and therapists. Our investigation shows that deep learning with spatio-temporal skeleton data and dynamic attention outperforms others, with an RMSE as low as 0.55. Fully automated rehabilitation is still in development, but, being an active research topic, it could hasten objective assessment and improve outreach.

**Abstract:**
Background Artificial intelligence (AI)–driven serious games have been used in health care to offer a customizable and immersive experience. Summarizing the features of the current AI-driven serious games is very important to explore how they have been developed and used and their current state to plan on how to leverage them in the current and future health care needs. Objective This study aimed to explore the features of AI-driven serious games in health care as reported by previous research. Methods We conducted a scoping review to achieve the abovementioned objective. The most popular databases in the information technology and health fields (ie, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, CINAHL, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar) were searched using keywords related to serious games and AI. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection process. Three reviewers independently extracted data from the included studies. A narrative approach was used for data synthesis. Results The search process returned 1470 records. Of these 1470 records, 46 (31.29%) met all eligibility criteria. A total of 64 different serious games were found in the included studies. Motor impairment was the most common health condition targeted by these serious games. Serious games were used for rehabilitation in most of the studies. The most common genres of serious games were role-playing games, puzzle games, and platform games. Unity was the most prominent game engine used to develop serious games. PCs were the most common platform used to play serious games. The most common algorithm used in the included studies was support vector machine. The most common purposes of AI were the detection of disease and the evaluation of user performance. The size of the data set ranged from 36 to 795,600. The most common validation techniques used in the included studies were k-fold cross-validation and training-test split validation. Accuracy was the most commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of AI models. Conclusions The last decade witnessed an increase in the development of AI-driven serious games for health care purposes, targeting various health conditions, and leveraging multiple AI algorithms; this rising trend is expected to continue for years to come. Although the evidence uncovered in this study shows promising applications of AI-driven serious games, larger and more rigorous, diverse, and robust studies may be needed to examine the efficacy and effectiveness of AI-driven serious games in different populations with different health conditions.

**Abstract:**
As life expectancy is mostly increasing, the incidence of many neurological disorders is also constantly growing. For improving the physical functions affected by a neurological disorder, rehabilitation procedures are mandatory, and they must be performed regularly. Unfortunately, neurorehabilitation procedures have disadvantages in terms of costs, accessibility and a lack of therapists. This paper presents Immersive Neurorehabilitation Exercises Using Virtual Reality (INREX-VR), our innovative immersive neurorehabilitation system using virtual reality. The system is based on a thorough research methodology and is able to capture real-time user movements and evaluate joint mobility for both upper and lower limbs, record training sessions and save electromyography data. The use of the first-person perspective increases immersion, and the joint range of motion is calculated with the help of both the HTC Vive system and inverse kinematics principles applied on skeleton rigs. Tutorial exercises are demonstrated by a virtual therapist, as they were recorded with real-life physicians, and sessions can be monitored and configured through tele-medicine. Complex movements are practiced in gamified settings, encouraging self-improvement and competition. Finally, we proposed a training plan and preliminary tests which show promising results in terms of accuracy and user feedback. As future developments, we plan to improve the system’s accuracy and investigate a wireless alternative based on neural networks.

**Abstract:**
Neurofeedback training (NFT) has shown promising results in recent years as a tool to address the effects of age-related cognitive decline in the elderly. Since previous studies have linked reduced complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signal to the process of cognitive decline, we propose the use of non-linear methods to characterise changes in EEG complexity induced by NFT. In this study, we analyse the pre- and post-training EEG from 11 elderly subjects who performed an NFT based on motor imagery (MI–NFT). Spectral changes were studied using relative power (RP) from classical frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta), whilst multiscale entropy (MSE) was applied to assess EEG-induced complexity changes. Furthermore, we analysed the subject’s scores from Luria tests performed before and after MI–NFT. We found that MI–NFT induced a power shift towards rapid frequencies, as well as an increase of EEG complexity in all channels, except for C3. These improvements were most evident in frontal channels. Moreover, results from cognitive tests showed significant enhancement in intellectual and memory functions. Therefore, our findings suggest the usefulness of MI–NFT to improve cognitive functions in the elderly and encourage future studies to use MSE as a metric to characterise EEG changes induced by MI–NFT.

**Abstract:**
Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently experience impairments in a range of abilities. Due to their poor attention and concentration, they find it challenging to stay focused when learning. They need help to retain the directions given by teachers and are very animated. Focus issues, hyperactivity, and attention problems may hamper learning. The needs and challenges of children with ADHD have been addressed by numerous digital solutions over the years. These solutions support a variety of needs (e.g., diagnosing versus treating), aim to address a variety of goals (e.g., addressing inattention, impulsivity, working memory, executive functions, emotion regulation), and employ a wide range of technologies, including video games, PC, mobile, web, AR, VR, tangible interfaces, wearables, robots, and BCI/neurofeedback, occasionally even in tandem. According to studies on the psychological impacts of serious games, immersive games can potentially be valuable tools for treating ADHD. This research investigates using PC, mobile/tablet applications, augmented reality, virtual reality, and brain–computer interfaces to develop executive functions and metacognitive and emotional competencies in children with ADHD through serious games. Following PRISMA 2020 criteria, this systematic review includes a comprehensive search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The database search provided 784 records, and 30 studies met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that serious games assisted by multiple technologies could significantly improve a wide range of cognitive and socioemotional meta-competencies among children with ADHD, including visuospatial working memory, attention, inhibition control, cognitive flexibility, planning/organizing, problem-solving, social communication, and emotional regulation. The results of this review may provide positive feedback for creating more inclusive digital training environments for the treatment of ADHD children.

## 11. Separability of motor imagery of the self from interpretation of motor intentions of others at the single trial level: an EEG study

- **Authors:** João Sousa Andrade, José Cecílio, Marco Simões, Francisco Sales, Miguel Castelo‐Branco

- **DOI:** 10.1186/s12984-017-0276-4
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 17
- **Journal:** Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation

**Abstract:**
The observed pattern of results show that Self and Third Person MI use distinct electrophysiological mechanisms detectable at the scalp (and ECOG) at the single trial level, with separable levels of involvement of the mirror neuron system in different regions. These observations provide a promising step to develop new BCI training/rehabilitation paradigms for patients with neurodevelopmental disorders of action understanding beyond simple imitation, such as autism, who would benefit from training and anticipation of the perceived intention of others as opposed to own intentions in social contexts.

**Abstract:**
This paper presents a systematic review of HCI literature focusing on children with ADHD, the prevailing mental health diagnosis in children. Its aim is to (i) chart the state-of-the-art in this domain (e.g. methods used), (ii) identify the ways the HCI community has addressed the needs of children with ADHD (e.g. technologies deployed), and (iii) describe the involvement of the various stakeholders playing a role in their everyday experiences (i.e. their care ecosystem). Our findings show limited engagement of the care ecosystem in the design, development and user studies of current technologies, and shortcomings in designing for multiple ecosystem stakeholders, despite their crucial role. We also find that most HCI contributions are systems aiming to address ADHD-related symptoms. Based on our findings, we provide suggestions for further research and design considerations for future systems that empower and promote the well-being of children with ADHD, while considering their care ecosystem.

## 13. Improving the Brain-Computer Interface Learning Process with Gamification in Motor Imagery: A Review

- **Authors:** Chongli Gao, Mingyue Xia, Zhehao Zhang, Yongpeng Han, Yaxin Gu
- **Year:** 2022

- **Journal:** IntechOpen eBooks

**Abstract:**
Brain-computer-interface-based motor imagery (MI-BCI), a control method for transferring the imagination of motor behavior to computer-based commands, could positively impact neural functions. With the safety guaranteed by non-invasive BCI devices, this method has the potential to enhance rehabilitation and physical outcomes. Therefore, this MI-BCI control strategy has been highly researched. However, applying a non-invasive MI-BCI to real life is still not ideal. One of the main reasons is the monotonous training procedure. Although researchers have reviewed optimized signal processing methods, no suggestion is found in training feedback design. The authors believe that enhancing the engagement interface via gamification presents a potential method that could increase the MI-BCI outcome. After analyzing 2524 articles (from 2001 to 2020), 28 pieces of research are finally used to evaluate the feasibility of using gamified MI-BCI system for training. This paper claims that gamification is feasible for MI-BCI training with an average accuracy of 74.35% among 111 individuals and positive reports from 26 out of 28 studies. Furthermore, this literature review suggests more emphasis should be on immersive and humanoid design for a gaming system, which could support relieving distraction, stimulate correct MI and improve learning outcomes. Interruptive training issues such as disturbing graphical interface design and potential solutions have also been presented for further research.

**Abstract:**
Introduction: Virtual Reality applications for rehabilitation are increasing in popularity. In traditional as well as virtual rehabilitation, the guidance of an occupational therapist through physical and verbal interaction is often required. Several studies have attempted to implement a virtual therapist or assistant in immersive virtual environments for rehabilitation. Objective: This research aims to systematically review these studies, understanding the therapist’s role and how they are represented in the virtual environment, how the virtual therapist and patient interact and the experience of users. Our goal is to provide guidance for virtual therapist implementations into fully immersive virtual reality environments. Method: The researchers systematically reviewed the literature on virtual therapists in immersive virtual environments for motor rehabilitation (protocol prospectively registered with PROSPERO ID: CRD42022357369). Results and Conclusion: Seven studies were identified, with findings showing that virtual therapists are often human-like avatars that guide patients, requiring them to mimic the therapist’s movements. Visual, haptic, or one-direction audio feedback from the therapist to the patient was provided in five studies. The selected studies were all newly developed custom-made systems, with five systems developed using the same game engine. Studies carrying out user testing utilised several methods to understand user experience, evidencing a positive attitude from therapists and motivated and satisfied patients. Future Research: The roles of virtual therapists for motor rehabilitation needs to be explored further in rigorous empirical studies to gather data on patient and therapist user experience. Considerable potential was identified in the development of virtual therapists and therapeutic alliance in the virtual environment. Future systems should reduce manual input from therapists and include personalisation and individualised patient feedback.

**Abstract:**
Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are specialized systems that allow users to control computer applications using their brain waves. With the arrival of consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) equipment, brain-controlled systems began to find fertile ground in mental training. One particular area that is gradually gaining attention is that of mindfulness training. In this paper, the results of a literature review of BCI-assisted mindfulness training using BCI’s are presented. The specific aim is to review the effects of BCIs embedded in mindfulness interventions on training metacognitive, emotional, and attention regulation skills. Papers published the last 10 years were reviewed. The results showed that the use of BCIs provides subjects the unique opportunity to self-regulate mental and emotional functions using the feedback derived from their own brain activity. Subjects were found to raise better awareness about the ways non-conscious operations influence mental and emotional states. It was observed that subjects by learning to deal with the neurofeedback within immersive worlds or with the aid of mobile devices can better develop awareness and self-regulation skills including inhibition and flexibility. Learning environments have been undergoing rapid change driven by the evolution and availability of digital technologies. In that vein, BCIs combined with mobiles and immersive technologies could support mindfulness as an innovative practice for cognitive, emotional, and metacognitive development. This study aims to contribute to the debate about the use of BCI-assisted mindfulness practices as proactive methods and training strategies for various target groups such as students, teachers, and workers to achieve well-being and peak performance.

- **Journal:** Journal of Clinical Medicine

**Abstract:**
Upper extremity (UE) paresis is one of the most frequent and disabling clinical consequences after stroke. Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) are wearable virtual reality devices that seem effective in promoting the recovery of functional abilities by increasing adherence levels in this population. This scoping review is aimed at collecting available evidence on the use of HMD-based immersive virtual reality systems for UE rehabilitation treatment in stroke survivors. Four electronic bibliographic databases were consulted from inception until 18 January 2023. A total of 19 clinical trials in which HMDs were used as a clinical tool for increasing UE functioning, as a single intervention or in adjunct to other rehab treatments, were included; no restrictions were applied for UE paresis severity or stroke onset. The large majority of the clinical trials involved chronic stroke patients (15 out of 19), with a wide range of UE impairments. Overall, HMD use seemed to be well-tolerated and promising for increasing UE motor function in adult chronic stroke survivors, with benefits in subjects’ arm use and independence. The possibility of executing highly realistic and task-oriented movements appears to be promising in enhancing gesture relevance, thus promoting new motor strategies in a “virtual ecological way”. Across studies, we found a high heterogeneity in protocol design and a lack of reporting that prevents us drawing conclusions regarding potential subgroups of patients that could benefit more from HMD-based interventions or suggested treatment modalities.

**Abstract:**
The holistic growth and psychological well-being of people with special needs and disabilities remain high on the priority agenda for sustainable and inclusive education. Digital well-being technologies and especially “smart technologies”, are ready to revolutionize mental health interventions by meeting trainees’ needs and providing them with more positive and transformative mental, emotional, and social experiences. Μeta-skills refer to a set of consciousness-raising competences that incorporate meta-cognitive, social–emotional, and motivational attributes, allowing individuals to intentionally achieve a state of optimal functioning. Although positive psychology and well-being technologies are considered promising intervention approaches, there is less knowledge regarding the effectiveness of such interventions among people with special needs and disabilities, especially in the crucial domain of meta-skills development. Thus, the current systematic review aims to examine positive psychology strategies as well as the synergy with well-being technologies in the development of metacognition, emotional intelligence, and motivation meta-skills in populations with special training needs and disabilities. The PRISMA methodology was utilized to answer the research questions. A total of forty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. The results indicated that positive psychology strategies improved a wide range of meta-skills, including self-regulation, emotional control, behavioral control, inhibition control, self-awareness, intrapersonal skills, interpersonal skills, adaptation, goal setting, and self-compassion. Artificial intelligence tools, wearables, smart applications, immersive technologies (virtual and augmented reality), neurofeedback and biofeedback technologies, as well as digital games were found to effectively assist such training programs. The results of the current review may provide positive feedback in the discussion about digitally-aided mental health interventions for training the meta-skills of mental and emotional health.

**Abstract:**
Human–machine interfaces (HMI) are currently a trendy and rapidly expanding area of research. Interestingly, the human user does not readily observe the interface between humans and machines. Instead, interactions between the machine and electrical signals from the user's body are obscured by complex control algorithms. The result is effectively a one-way street, wherein data is only transmitted from human to machine. Thus, a gap remains in the literature: how can information be effectively conveyed to the user to enable mutual understanding between humans and machines? Here, this paper reviews recent advancements in biosignal-integrated wearable robotics, with a particular emphasis on “visualization”—the presentation of relevant data, statistics, and visual feedback to the user. This review article covers various signals of interest, such as electroencephalograms and electromyograms, and explores novel sensor architectures and key materials. Recent developments in wearable robotics are examined from control and mechanical design perspectives. Additionally, we discuss current visualization methods and outline the field's future direction. While much of the HMI field focuses on biomedical and healthcare applications, such as rehabilitation of spinal cord injury and stroke patients, this paper also covers less common applications in manufacturing, defense, and other domains.

**Abstract:**
Reactive balance is postulated to be attentionally demanding, although it has been underexamined in dual-tasking (DT) conditions. Further, DT studies have mainly included only one cognitive task, leaving it unknown how different cognitive domains contribute to reactive balance. This study examined how DT affected reactive responses to large-magnitude perturbations and compared cognitive-motor interference (CMI) between cognitive tasks. A total of 20 young adults aged 18–35 (40% female; 25.6 ± 3.8 y) were exposed to treadmill support surface perturbations alone (single-task (ST)) and while completing four cognitive tasks: Target, Track, Auditory Clock Test (ACT), Letter Number Sequencing (LNS). Three perturbations were delivered over 30 s in each trial. Cognitive tasks were also performed while seated and standing (ST). Compared to ST, post-perturbation MOS was lower when performing Track, and cognitive performance was reduced on the Target task during DT (p &lt; 0.05). There was a larger decline in overall (cognitive + motor) performance from ST for both of the visuomotor tasks compared to the ACT and LNS (p &lt; 0.05). The highest CMI was observed for visuomotor tasks; real-life visuomotor tasks could increase fall risk during daily living, especially for individuals with difficulty attending to more than one task.

**Abstract:**
This study compares the influence of a gamified and a non-gamified virtual reality (VR) environment on wheelchair skills training. In specific, the study explores the integration of gamification elements and their influence on wheelchair driving performance in VR-based training. Twenty-two non-disabled participants volunteered for the study, of whom eleven undertook the gamified VR training, and eleven engaged in the non-gamified VR training. To measure the efficacy of the VR-based wheelchair skills training, we captured the heart rate (HR), number of joystick movements, completion time, and number of collisions. In addition, an adapted version of the Wheelchair Skills Training Program Questionnaire (WSTP-Q), the Igroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ), and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) questionnaires were administered after the VR training. The results showed no differences in wheelchair driving performance, the level of involvement, or the ratings of presence between the two environments. In contrast, the perceived cybersickness was statistically higher for the group of participants who trained in the non-gamified VR environment. Remarkably, heightened cybersickness symptoms aligned with increased HR, suggesting physiological connections. As such, while direct gamification effects on the efficacy of VR-based wheelchair skills training were not statistically significant, its potential to amplify user engagement and reduce cybersickness is evident.
