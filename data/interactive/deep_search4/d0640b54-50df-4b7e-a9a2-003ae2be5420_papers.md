**Abstract:**
Heightened reliance on the cerebral cortex for postural stability with aging is well-known, yet the cortical mechanisms for balance control, particularly in relation to balance function, remain unclear. Here we aimed to investigate motor cortical activity in relation to the level of balance challenge presented during reactive balance recovery and identify circuit-specific interactions between motor cortex and prefrontal or somatosensory regions in relation to metrics of balance function that predict fall risk. Using electroencephalography, we assessed motor cortical beta power, and beta coherence during balance reactions to perturbations in older adults. We found that individuals with greater motor cortical beta power evoked following standing balance perturbations demonstrated lower general clinical balance function. Individual older adults demonstrated a wide range of cortical responses during balance reactions at the same perturbation magnitude, showing no group-level change in prefrontal- or somatosensory-motor coherence in response to perturbations. However, older adults with the highest prefrontal-motor coherence during the post-perturbation, but not pre-perturbation, period showed greater cognitive dual-task interference (DTI) and elicited stepping reactions at lower perturbation magnitudes. Our results support motor cortical beta activity as a potential biomarker for individual level of balance challenge and implicate prefrontal-motor cortical networks in distinct aspects of balance control involving response inhibition of reactive stepping in older adults. Cortical network activity during balance may provide a neural target for precision-medicine efforts aimed at fall prevention with aging.

**Abstract:**
Many elderly people underestimated or overestimated their risk of falling. Such disparities between perceived and physiological fall risk were primarily associated with psychological measures and strongly influenced the probability of falling. Measures of both physiological and perceived fall risk should be included in fall risk assessments to allow tailoring of interventions for preventing falls in elderly people.

**Abstract:**
This study aimed to investigate the effects of a rhythm-motor dual task intervention on cognitive and gait control for older adults in relation to fall prevention. Ten healthy older adults participated in a rhythm-motor dual task intervention and 10 participated in the control group. The intervention group received 16 30-min intervention sessions for 8 weeks. During the intervention sessions, participants engaged in walking or bimanual tapping as a primary motor task with concurrent rhythm tasks including playing instruments and rhythmic chanting or singing. At pretest and post-test, measures of cognition, balance/mobility, and gait were administered. A significant difference between groups was found for part B of the Trail Making Test (TMT-B) measure that involved executive control of attention. Also, changes in the gait ratio in the dual task condition of walking while playing an instrument were significantly different between groups. The findings in this study support the use of the rhythm-motor dual task intervention for increasing available cognitive resources and improving gait control, which are critical factors in fall prevention.

**Abstract:**
The ESH/ESC Guidelines represent the views of the ESH and ESC and were arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence at the time they were written.Health professionals are encouraged to take them fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement. The guidelines do not, however, override the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patients, in consultation with that patient, and where appropriate and necessary the patient’s guardian or carer. It is also the health professional’s responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.

## 6. Postural orientation and equilibrium: what do we need to know about neural control of balance to prevent falls?

- **Journal:** Age and Ageing

**Abstract:**
Postural control is no longer considered simply a summation of static reflexes but, rather, a complex skill based on the interaction of dynamic sensorimotor processes. The two main functional goals of postural behaviour are postural orientation and postural equilibrium. Postural orientation involves the active alignment of the trunk and head with respect to gravity, support surfaces, the visual surround and internal references. Sensory information from somatosensory, vestibular and visual systems is integrated, and the relative weights placed on each of these inputs are dependent on the goals of the movement task and the environmental context. Postural equilibrium involves the coordination of movement strategies to stabilise the centre of body mass during both self-initiated and externally triggered disturbances of stability. The specific response strategy selected depends not only on the characteristics of the external postural displacement but also on the individual's expectations, goals and prior experience. Anticipatory postural adjustments, prior to voluntary limb movement, serve to maintain postural stability by compensating for destabilising forces associated with moving a limb. The amount of cognitive processing required for postural control depends both on the complexity of the postural task and on the capability of the subject's postural control system. The control of posture involves many different underlying physiological systems that can be affected by pathology or sub-clinical constraints. Damage to any of the underlying systems will result in different, context-specific instabilities. The effective rehabilitation of balance to improve mobility and to prevent falls requires a better understanding of the multiple mechanisms underlying postural control.

## 8. COGNITIVE FUNCTION MAY BE IMPORTANT FOR FALL INJURY PREVENTION TRIALS

**Abstract:**
To the Editor: We read with interest the recent paper by Lamb et al.1 We found the process of identifying a common outcome data set for fall injury prevention for European trials interesting and informative and congratulate the investigators for their efforts. This work is somewhat reminiscent of the Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques collaborative effort,2 in which investigators moved the field of falls research forward in the early 1990s. Nevertheless, we were surprised by the committee's recommendations with regard to cognitive function. It was not clear whether this feature was purposely being left out altogether or if this was merely not being included as a target for reducing fall-related injuries. Either way, we wish to call attention to a growing body of research that links cognitive function, gait disturbances, and falls. Using dual-task paradigms, many studies have demonstrated that cognitive resources, in particular attention, are necessary for the proper maintenance of balance and gait and that subjects with an increased risk of falls display a heightened adverse response to dual tasking.3 For example, we found that an attention-demanding task does not affect the stride variability of healthy older adults but markedly increases stride variability, a marker of fall risk, in older adults prone to falls.4 A number of investigations have also demonstrated an association between cognitive function, gait instability, gait speed, and other measures related to fall risk.4,5 Moreover, "stops walking while talking" has been shown to predict falls in older adults,6 and executive function and other aspects of cognitive function are apparently altered in fallers and may also be predictive.4,7,8 Finally, studies on patients with Alzheimer's disease may offer further insight into the relationship between cognitive function and falls. These patients suffer from a highly increased fall risk with a fracture rate that is two to three times as high as that of the age- and sex-matched general population.9 This is likely due to deficits in cognitive function (perhaps they take inappropriate risks), because traditional aspects of motor function do not predict falls in this population. In addition, intervention programs that do not include a focus on cognitive function have not been successful in reducing fall risk in this population.10 It may, perhaps, be premature to target cognitive function as an outcome measure in trials designed to reduce fall-related injuries. Nonetheless, we suggest that there is already sufficient evidence to warrant inclusion of cognitive function measures, in particular attention and executive function, in any such trials, at least as a baseline covariate, to adequately characterize the study population and the propensity to fall.

## 9. Reduced Cognitive-Motor Interference on Voluntary Balance Control in Older Tai Chi Practitioners

- **Authors:** Rini Varghese, C.W.Y. Hui-Chan, Tanvi Bhatt

- **DOI:** 10.1519/jpt.0000000000000066
- **Source:** openalex
- **Citations:** 14
- **Journal:** Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy

**Abstract:**
Background and Purpose: Recent dual-task studies suggest that Tai Chi practitioners displayed better control of standing posture and maintained a quicker response time of postural muscle activation during a stepping down activity. Whether this effect extends to voluntary balance control, specifically the limits of excursion of the center of pressure, remains to be examined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cognitive-motor interference pattern by examining the effects of a concurrently performed cognitive task on attention of voluntary balance control in older adults who are long-term practitioners of Tai Chi. Methods: Ten older Tai Chi practitioners and 10 age-matched nonpractitioners performed a voluntary balance task that required them to shift their weight to reach a preset target in the forward and backward directions, with (single task, ST) and without (dual task, DT) a secondary cognitive task, which was the counting backward task. The counting backward task required the individual to compute and verbalize a series of arithmetic differences between a given pair of randomly generated numbers. The cognitive task was also performed independently (cognitive-ST). All trials were performed in a random order. Balance outcomes included reaction time, movement velocity, and maximal excursion of the center of pressure provided by the NeuroCom system. Cognitive outcome was the number of correct responses generated within the 8-second trial during the ST and DT conditions. Outcome variables were analyzed using a 2-factor, group by task, analysis of variance. DT costs for the variables were calculated as the relative difference between ST and DT conditions and were compared between the 2 groups using independent t tests. Results: Tai Chi practitioners displayed shorter reaction times ( P &lt; .001) and faster movement velocities ( P &lt; .05) of their center of pressure than older nonpractitioners for both directions; however, no difference was found between the maximal excursions of the 2 groups. Cost analyses revealed that reaction time and cognitive costs were significantly lower in the Tai Chi practitioners for both forward and backward directions ( P &lt; .05); however, similar findings for movement velocity costs were significant only in the backward direction ( P &lt; .05). Discussion and Conclusions: Our results suggest that Tai Chi practitioners expended fewer motor and cognitive resources than older nonpractitioners during a fairly complex (dynamic) postural equilibrium task while performing a verbal working memory task. They exhibited lesser cognitive-motor interference and thus better allocation of attentional resources toward the voluntary balance control task. Given that dynamic balance is a crucial prerequisite for walking and dual-tasking ability is considered to be a significant predictor of falls in older adults, our results might point at the possible long-term benefits of Tai Chi practice to counteract age-related decline in dual-tasking ability. Findings present preliminary data for further investigation, especially related to potential benefits in fall prevention.

- **Journal:** Age and Ageing

**Abstract:**
Abstract Background falls and fall-related injuries are common in older adults, have negative effects on functional independence and quality of life and are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and health related costs. Current guidelines are inconsistent, with no up-to-date, globally applicable ones present. Objectives to create a set of evidence- and expert consensus-based falls prevention and management recommendations applicable to older adults for use by healthcare and other professionals that consider: (i) a person-centred approach that includes the perspectives of older adults with lived experience, caregivers and other stakeholders; (ii) gaps in previous guidelines; (iii) recent developments in e-health and (iv) implementation across locations with limited access to resources such as low- and middle-income countries. Methods a steering committee and a worldwide multidisciplinary group of experts and stakeholders, including older adults, were assembled. Geriatrics and gerontological societies were represented. Using a modified Delphi process, recommendations from 11 topic-specific working groups (WGs), 10 ad-hoc WGs and a WG dealing with the perspectives of older adults were reviewed and refined. The final recommendations were determined by voting. Recommendations all older adults should be advised on falls prevention and physical activity. Opportunistic case finding for falls risk is recommended for community-dwelling older adults. Those considered at high risk should be offered a comprehensive multifactorial falls risk assessment with a view to co-design and implement personalised multidomain interventions. Other recommendations cover details of assessment and intervention components and combinations, and recommendations for specific settings and populations. Conclusions the core set of recommendations provided will require flexible implementation strategies that consider both local context and resources.

- **Citations:** 10
- **Journal:** N/A

**Abstract:**
The GAME2A WE platform aims to provide a versatile tool for elderly fall prevention through exergames that integrate aerobic, strength-enhancing and balance-enhancing exercises. In addition, cognitive improvements are expected due to dual task training activities. In this context, the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) to build such exergames is investigated through a review of relevant literature and an evaluation study of a functional prototype of the GAME2A WE platform. Fall prevention exercises have been integrated into two scenario-based exergame themes, "Life on a Farm" and "Fun Park Tour", to be able to assess their applicability on the targeted users based on healthcare experts' evaluation. Test and evaluation sessions were conducted with eight end-users and four experts. The results indicate a positive assessment by the research sample in terms of usability, tolerability, and applicability. Feedback from user testing will be used for the final development stage which will fuel a pilot trial to assess the effects of AR and VR-based motor-cognitive training in community-dwelling older adults.

**Abstract:**
Abstract This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease, including prevalence and incidence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on family caregivers, the dementia workforce and society. The Special Report examines the patient journey from awareness of cognitive changes to potential treatment with drugs that change the underlying biology of Alzheimer's. An estimated 6.7 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD. Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in 2019, and Alzheimer's disease was officially listed as the sixth‐leading cause of death in the United States. In 2020 and 2021, when COVID‐19 entered the ranks of the top ten causes of death, Alzheimer's was the seventh‐leading cause of death. Alzheimer's remains the fifth‐leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths from AD increased more than 145%. This trajectory of deaths from AD was likely exacerbated by the COVID‐19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2022. These figures reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving was valued at $339.5 billion in 2022. Its costs, however, extend to family caregivers’ increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes — costs that have been aggravated by COVID‐19. Members of the paid health care workforce are involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for people with dementia. In recent years, however, a shortage of such workers has developed in the United States. This shortage — brought about, in part, by COVID‐19 — has occurred at a time when more members of the dementia care workforce are needed. Therefore, programs will be needed to attract workers and better train health care teams. Average per‐person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are almost three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2023 for health care, long‐term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $345 billion. The Special Report examines whether there will be sufficient numbers of physician specialists to provide Alzheimer's care and treatment now that two drugs are available that change the underlying biology of Alzheimer's disease.

**Abstract:**
Abstract Heightened reliance on the cerebral cortex for postural stability with aging is well-known, yet the cortical dynamics of balance control, particularly in relationship to balance function, is unclear. Here we aimed to investigate motor cortical activity in relationship to the level of balance challenge presented during reactive balance recovery, and identify circuit-specific interactions between motor cortex and prefrontal or somatosensory regions to metrics of balance function that predict fall risk. Using electroencephalography, we assessed motor cortical beta power, and beta coherence during balance reactions to perturbations in older adults. We found that individuals with greater somatosensory-motor beta coherence at baseline and lower beta power evoked over motor regions following perturbations demonstrated higher general clinical balance function. At the group-level, beta coherence between prefrontal-motor regions reduced during balance reactions. Older adults with the highest post-perturbation prefrontal-motor coherence showed greater cognitive dual-task interference and elicited stepping reactions at lower perturbation magnitudes. Our results support motor cortical beta activity as a potential biomarker for individual level of balance challenge and implicate prefrontal-and somatosensory-motor cortical networks in different aspects of balance control in older adults. Cortical network activity during balance may provide a neural target for precision-medicine efforts aimed at fall-prevention with aging.

- **Journal:** Physical Therapy

**Abstract:**
Background Current clinical balance assessment tools do not aim to help therapists identify the underlying postural control systems responsible for poor functional balance. By identifying the disordered systems underlying balance control, therapists can direct specific types of intervention for different types of balance problems. Objective The goal of this study was to develop a clinical balance assessment tool that aims to target 6 different balance control systems so that specific rehabilitation approaches can be designed for different balance deficits. This article presents the theoretical framework, interrater reliability, and preliminary concurrent validity for this new instrument, the Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest). Design The BESTest consists of 36 items, grouped into 6 systems: “Biomechanical Constraints,” “Stability Limits/Verticality,” “Anticipatory Postural Adjustments,” “Postural Responses,” “Sensory Orientation,” and “Stability in Gait.” Methods In 2 interrater trials, 22 subjects with and without balance disorders, ranging in age from 50 to 88 years, were rated concurrently on the BESTest by 19 therapists, students, and balance researchers. Concurrent validity was measured by correlation between the BESTest and balance confidence, as assessed with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale. Results Consistent with our theoretical framework, subjects with different diagnoses scored poorly on different sections of the BESTest. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for interrater reliability for the test as a whole was .91, with the 6 section ICCs ranging from .79 to .96. The Kendall coefficient of concordance among raters ranged from .46 to 1.00 for the 36 individual items. Concurrent validity of the correlation between the BESTest and the ABC Scale was r=.636, P&amp;lt;.01. Limitations Further testing is needed to determine whether: (1) the sections of the BESTest actually detect independent balance deficits, (2) other systems important for balance control should be added, and (3) a shorter version of the test is possible by eliminating redundant or insensitive items. Conclusions The BESTest is easy to learn to administer, with excellent reliability and very good validity. It is unique in allowing clinicians to determine the type of balance problems to direct specific treatments for their patients. By organizing clinical balance test items already in use, combined with new items not currently available, the BESTest is the most comprehensive clinical balance tool available and warrants further development.

## 17. Central role of the brain in stress and adaptation: Links to socioeconomic status, health, and disease

**Abstract:**
The brain is the key organ of stress reactivity, coping, and recovery processes. Within the brain, a distributed neural circuitry determines what is threatening and thus stressful to the individual. Instrumental brain systems of this circuitry include the hippocampus, amygdala, and areas of the prefrontal cortex. Together, these systems regulate physiological and behavioral stress processes, which can be adaptive in the short‐term and maladaptive in the long‐term. Importantly, such stress processes arise from bidirectional patterns of communication between the brain and the autonomic, cardiovascular, and immune systems via neural and endocrine mechanisms underpinning cognition, experience, and behavior. In one respect, these bidirectional stress mechanisms are protective in that they promote short‐term adaptation ( allostasis ). In another respect, however, these stress mechanisms can lead to a long‐term dysregulation of allostasis in that they promote maladaptive wear‐and‐tear on the body and brain under chronically stressful conditions ( allostatic load ), compromising stress resiliency and health. This review focuses specifically on the links between stress‐related processes embedded within the social environment and embodied within the brain, which is viewed as the central mediator and target of allostasis and allostatic load.

## 18. Hepatic encephalopathy in chronic liver disease: 2014 Practice Guideline by the American Association for the Study Of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver

**Abstract:**
The AASLD/EASL Practice Guideline Subcommittee on Hepatic Encephalopathy are: Jayant A. Talwalkar (Chair, AASLD), Hari S. Conjeevaram, Michael Porayko, Raphael B. Merriman, Peter L.M. Jansen, and Fabien Zoulim. This guideline has been approved by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver and represents the position of both associations. These recommendations provide a data-supported approach. They are based on the following: (1) formal review and analysis of the recently published world literature on the topic; (2) guideline policies covered by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/European Association for the Study of the Liver (AASLD/EASL) Policy on the Joint Development and Use of Practice Guidelines; and (3) the experience of the authors in the specified topic. Intended for use by physicians, these recommendations suggest preferred approaches to the diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive aspects of care. They are intended to be flexible, in contrast to standards of care, which are inflexible policies to be followed in every case. Specific recommendations are based on relevant published information. To more fully characterize the available evidence supporting the recommendations, the AASLD/EASL Practice Guidelines Subcommittee has adopted the classification used by the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) workgroup, with minor modifications (Table 1). The classifications and recommendations are based on three categories: the source of evidence in levels I through III; the quality of evidence designated by high (A), moderate (B), or low quality (C); and the strength of recommendations classified as strong (1) or weak (2). The literature databases and search strategies are outlined below. The resulting literature database was available to all members of the writing group (i.e., the authors). They selected references within their field of expertise and experience and graded the references according to the GRADE system.1 The selection of references for the guideline was based on a validation of the appropriateness of the study design for the stated purpose, a relevant number of patients under study, and confidence in the participating centers and authors. References on original data were preferred and those that were found unsatisfactory in any of these respects were excluded from further evaluation. There may be limitations in this approach when recommendations are needed on rare problems or problems on which scant original data are available. In such cases, it may be necessary to rely on less-qualified references with a low grading. As a result of the important changes in the treatment of complications of cirrhosis (renal failure, infections, and variceal bleeding [VB]), studies performed more than 30 years ago have generally not been considered for these guidelines. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a frequent complication and one of the most debilitating manifestations of liver disease, severely affecting the lives of patients and their caregivers. Furthermore, cognitive impairment associated with cirrhosis results in utilization of more health care resources in adults than other manifestations of liver disease.2 Progress in the area has been hindered by the complex pathogenesis that is not yet fully elucidated. Apart from such biological factors, there remains the larger obstacle that there are no universally accepted standards for the definition, diagnosis, classification, or treatment of HE, mostly as a result of insufficient clinical studies and standardized definitions. Clinical management tends to be dependent on local standards and personal views. This is an unfavorable situation for patients and contrasts with the severity of the condition and the high level of standardization in other complications of cirrhosis. The lack of consistency in the nomenclature and general standards renders comparisons among studies and patient populations difficult, introduces bias, and hinders progress in clinical research for HE. The latest attempts to standardize the nomenclature were published in 2002 and suggestions for the design of HE trials in 2011. Because there is an unmet need for recommendations on the clinical management of HE, the EASL and the AASLD jointly agreed to create these practice guidelines. It is beyond the scope of these guidelines to elaborate on the theories of pathogenesis of HE, as well as the management of encephalopathy resulting from acute liver failure (ALF), which has been published as guidelines recently. Rather, its aim is to present standardized terminology and recommendations to all health care workers who have patients with HE, regardless of their medical discipline, and focus on adult patients with chronic liver disease (CLD), which is, by far, the most frequent scenario. As these guidelines on HE were created, the authors found a limited amount of high-quality evidence to extract from the existing literature. There are many reasons for this; the elusive character of HE is among them, as well as the lack of generally accepted and utilized terms for description and categorization of HE. This makes a practice guideline all the more necessary for future improvement of clinical studies and, subsequently, the quality of management of patients with HE. With the existing body of evidence, these guidelines encompass the authors' best, carefully considered opinions. Although not all readers may necessarily agree with all aspects of the guidelines, their creation and adherence to them is the best way forward, with future adjustments when there is emergence of new evidence. Advanced liver disease and portosystemic shunting (PSS), far from being an isolated disorder of the liver, have well-known consequences on the body and, notably, on brain functioning. The alterations of brain functioning, which can produce behavioral, cognitive, and motor effects, were termed portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE)3 and later included in the term HE.4 Unless the underlying liver disease is successfully treated, HE is associated with poor survival and a high risk of recurrence.5, 6 Even in its mildest form, HE reduces health-related quality of life and is a risk factor for bouts of severe HE.7-9 Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction caused by liver insufficiency and/or PSS; it manifests as a wide spectrum of neurological or psychiatric abnormalities ranging from subclinical alterations to coma. This definition, in line with previous versions,10, 11 is based on the concept that encephalopathies are "diffuse disturbances of brain function"5 and that the adjective "hepatic" implies a causal connection to liver insufficiency and/or perihepatic vascular shunting.6 The incidence and prevalence of HE are related to the severity of the underlying liver insufficiency and PSS.12-15 In patients with cirrhosis, fully symptomatic overt HE (OHE) is an event that defines the decompensated phase of the disease, such as VB or ascites.7 Overt hepatic encephalopathy is also reported in subjects without cirrhosis with extensive PSS.8, 9 The manifestation of HE may not be an obvious clinical finding and there are multiple tools used for its detection, which influences the variation in the reported incidence and prevalence rates. The prevalence of OHE at the time of diagnosis of cirrhosis is 10%-14% in general,16-18 16%-21% in those with decompensated cirrhosis,7, 19 and 10%-50% in patients with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).20, 21 The cumulated numbers indicate that OHE will occur in 30%-40% of those with cirrhosis at some time during their clinical course and in the survivors in most cases repeatedly.22 Minimal HE (MHE) or covert HE (CHE) occurs in 20%-80% of patients with cirrhosis.23-27, 81 The prevalence of HE in prehepatic noncirrhotic portal hypertension (PH) is not well defined. The risk for the first bout of OHE is 5%-25% within 5 years after cirrhosis diagnosis, depending on the presence of risk factors, such as other complications to cirrhosis (MHE or CHE, infections, VB, or ascites) and probably diabetes and hepatitis C.28-32 Subjects with a previous bout of OHE were found to have a 40% cumulative risk of recurring OHE at 1 year,33 and subjects with recurrent OHE have a 40% cumulative risk of another recurrence within 6 months, despite lactulose treatment. Even individuals with cirrhosis and only mild cognitive dysfunction or mild electroencephalography (EEG) slowing develop approximately one bout of OHE per 3 years of survival.34, 35 After TIPS, the median cumulative 1-year incidence of OHE is 10%-50%36, 37 and is greatly influenced by the patient selection criteria adopted.38 Comparable data were obtained by PSS surgery.39 It gives an idea of the frequent confrontation of the health care system by patients with HE that they accounted for approximately 110,000 hospitalizations yearly (2005-2009)40 in the United States. Though numbers in the European Union (EU) are not readily available, these predictions are expected to be similar. Furthermore, the burden of CLD and cirrhosis is rapidly increasing,41, 42 and more cases will likely be encountered to further define the epidemiology of HE. Hepatic encephalopathy produces a wide spectrum of nonspecific neurological and psychiatric manifestations.10 In its lowest expression,43, 44 HE alters only psychometric tests oriented toward attention, working memory (WM), psychomotor speed, and visuospatial ability, as well as electrophysiological and other functional brain measures.45, 46 As HE progresses, personality changes, such as apathy, irritability, and disinhibition, may be reported by the patient's relatives,47 and obvious alterations in consciousness and motor function occur. Disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle with excessive daytime sleepiness are frequent,48 whereas complete reversal of the sleep-wake cycle is less consistently observed.49, 50 Patients may develop progressive disorientation to time and space, inappropriate behavior, and acute confusional state with agitation or somnolence, stupor, and, finally, coma.51 The recent ISHEN (International Society for Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism) consensus uses the onset of disorientation or asterixis as the onset of OHE.65 In noncomatose patients with HE, motor system abnormalities, such as hypertonia, hyper-reflexia, and a positive Babinski sign, can be observed. In contrast, deep tendon reflexes may diminish and even disappear in coma,52 although pyramidal signs can still be observed. Rarely, transient focal neurological deficits can occur.53 Seizures are very rarely reported in HE.54-56 Extrapyramidal dysfunction, such as hypomimia, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, hypokinesia, monotony and slowness of speech, parkinsonian-like tremor, and dyskinesia with diminished voluntary movements, are common findings; in contrast, the presence of involuntary movements similar to tics or chorea occur rarely.52, 57 Asterixis or "flapping tremor" is often present in the early to middle stages of HE that precede stupor or coma and is, in actuality, not a tremor, but a negative myoclonus consisting of loss of postural tone. It is easily elicited by actions that require postural tone, such as hyperextension of the wrists with separated fingers or the rhythmic squeezing of the examiner's fingers. However, asterixis can be observed in other areas, such as the feet, legs, arms, tongue, and eyelids. Asterixis is not pathognomonic of HE because it can be observed in other diseases57 (e.g., uremia). Notably, the mental (either cognitive or behavioral) and motor signs of HE may not be expressed, or do not progress in parallel, in each individual, therefore producing difficulties in staging the severity of HE. Hepatic myelopathy (HM)58 is a particular pattern of HE possibly related to marked, long-standing portocaval shunting, characterized by severe motor abnormalities exceeding the mental dysfunction. Cases of paraplegia with progressive spasticity and weakness of lower limbs with hyper-reflexia and relatively mild persistent or recurrent mental alterations have been reported and do not respond to standard therapy, including ammonia lowering, but may reverse with liver transplantation (LT).59 Persistent HE may present with prominent extrapyramidal and/or pyramidal signs, partially overlapping with HM, in which postmortem brain examination reveals brain atrophy.60 This condition was previously called acquired hepatolenticular degeneration, a term currently considered obsolete. However, this cirrhosis-associated parkinsonism is unresponsive to ammonia-lowering therapy and may be more common than originally thought in patients with advanced liver disease, presenting in approximately 4% of cases.61 Apart from these less-usual manifestations of HE, it is widely accepted in clinical practice that all forms of HE and their manifestations are completely reversible, and this assumption still is a well-founded operational basis for treatment strategies. However, research on liver-transplanted HE patients and on patients after resolution of repeated bouts of OHE casts doubt on the full reversibility. Some mental deficits, apart from those ascribable to other transplantation-related causes, may persist and are mentioned later under transplantation.135 Likewise, episodes of OHE may be associated with persistent cumulative deficits in WM and learning.14 Hepatic encephalopathy should be classified according to all of the following four factors.10 According to the underlying disease, HE is subdivided into According to the severity of manifestations. The continuum that is HE has been arbitrarily subdivided. For clinical and research purposes, a scheme of such grading is provided (Table 2). Operative classifications that refer to defined functional impairments aim at increasing intra- and inter-rater reliability and should be used whenever possible. According to its time course, HE is subdivided into According to the existence of precipitating factors, HE is subdivided into No universal criteria for diagnosis Local standards and expertise required • Trivial lack of awareness • Euphoria or anxiety • Shortened attention span • Impairment of addition or subtraction • Altered sleep rhythm • Lethargy or apathy • Disorientation for time • Obvious personality change • Inappropriate behavior • Dyspraxia • Asterixis • Somnolence to semistupor • Responsive to stimuli • Confused • Gross disorientation • Bizarre behavior A fifth classification, according to whether or not the patient has acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), has recently been suggested.64 Although the management, mechanism, and prognostic impact differ, this classification is still a research area. The diagnosis requires the detection of signs suggestive of HE in a patient with severe liver insufficiency and/or PSS who does not have obvious alternative causes of brain dysfunction. The recognition of precipitating factors for HE (e.g., infection, bleeding, and constipation) supports the diagnosis of HE. The differential diagnosis should consider common disorders altering the level of consciousness (Table 4). 1. Hepatic encephalopathy should be classified according to the type of underlying disease, severity of manifestations, time course, and precipitating factors (GRADE III, A, 1). 2. A diagnostic workup is required, considering other disorders that can alter brain function and mimic HE (GRADE II-2, A, 1). Every case and bout of HE should be described and classified according to all four factors, and this should be repeated at relevant intervals according to the clinical situation. The recommendations are summarized in Table 5. Judging and measuring the severity of HE is approached as a continuum.65 The testing strategies in place range from simple clinical scales to sophisticated psychometric and neurophysiological tools; however, none of the current tests are valid for the entire spectrum.11, 66 The appropriate testing and diagnostic options differ according to the acuity of the presentation and the degree of impairment.67 The diagnosis of OHE is based on a clinical examination and a clinical decision. Clinical scales are used to analyze its severity. Specific quantitative tests are only needed in study settings. The gold standard is the West Haven criteria (WHC; Table 2, including clinical description). However, they are subjective tools with limited interobserver reliability, especially for grade I HE, because slight hypokinesia, psychomotor slowing, and a lack of attention can easily be overlooked in clinical examination. In contrast, the detection of disorientation and asterixis has good inter-rater reliability and thus are chosen as marker symptoms of OHE.67 Orientation or mixed scales have been used to distinguish the severity of HE.68, 69 In patients with significantly altered consciousness, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS; Table 6) is widely employed and supplies an operative, robust description. Diagnosing cognitive dysfunction is not difficult. It can be established from clinical observation as well as neuropsychological or neurophysiological tests. The difficulty is to assign them to HE. For this reason, OHE still remains a diagnosis of exclusion in this patient population that is often susceptible to mental status abnormalities resulting from medications, alcohol abuse, drug use, effects of hyponatremia, and psychiatric disease (Table 4). Therefore, as clinically indicated, exclusion of other etiologies by laboratory and radiological assessment for a patient with altered mental status in HE is warranted. Minimal hepatic encephalopathy and CHE is defined as the presence of test-dependent or clinical signs of brain dysfunction in patients with CLD who are not disoriented or display asterixis.

**Abstract:**
Studies supporting the notion that physical activity and exercise can help alleviate the negative impact of age on the body and the mind abound. This literature review provides an overview of important findings in this fast growing research domain. Results from cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intervention studies with healthy older adults, frail patients, and persons suffering from mild cognitive impairment and dementia are reviewed and discussed. Together these finding suggest that physical exercise is a promising nonpharmaceutical intervention to prevent age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases.

## 20. Self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-transcendence (S-ART): a framework for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of mindfulness

**Abstract:**
Mindfulness-as a state, trait, process, type of meditation, and intervention has proven to be beneficial across a diverse group of psychological disorders as well as for general stress reduction. Yet, there remains a lack of clarity in the operationalization of this construct, and underlying mechanisms. Here, we provide an integrative theoretical framework and systems-based neurobiological model that explains the mechanisms by which mindfulness reduces biases related to self-processing and creates a sustainable healthy mind. Mindfulness is described through systematic mental training that develops meta-awareness (self-awareness), an ability to effectively modulate one's behavior (self-regulation), and a positive relationship between self and other that transcends self-focused needs and increases prosocial characteristics (self-transcendence). This framework of self-awareness, -regulation, and -transcendence (S-ART) illustrates a method for becoming aware of the conditions that cause (and remove) distortions or biases. The development of S-ART through meditation is proposed to modulate self-specifying and narrative self-networks through an integrative fronto-parietal control network. Relevant perceptual, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral neuropsychological processes are highlighted as supporting mechanisms for S-ART, including intention and motivation, attention regulation, emotion regulation, extinction and reconsolidation, prosociality, non-attachment, and decentering. The S-ART framework and neurobiological model is based on our growing understanding of the mechanisms for neurocognition, empirical literature, and through dismantling the specific meditation practices thought to cultivate mindfulness. The proposed framework will inform future research in the contemplative sciences and target specific areas for development in the treatment of psychological disorders.

**Abstract:**
Stroke is the second leading cause of death and a major contributor to disability worldwide. The prevalence of stroke is highest in developing countries, with ischemic stroke being the most common type. Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the pathophysiology of stroke and the underlying mechanisms leading to ischemic insult. Stroke therapy primarily focuses on restoring blood flow to the brain and treating stroke-induced neurological damage. Lack of success in recent clinical trials has led to significant refinement of animal models, focus-driven study design and use of new technologies in stroke research. Simultaneously, despite progress in stroke management, post-stroke care exerts a substantial impact on families, the healthcare system and the economy. Improvements in pre-clinical and clinical care are likely to underpin successful stroke treatment, recovery, rehabilitation and prevention. In this review, we focus on the pathophysiology of stroke, major advances in the identification of therapeutic targets and recent trends in stroke research.

- **Journal:** Age and Ageing

**Abstract:**
the method used to define cognitive impairment and the type of fall outcome are both important when quantifying risk. There is strong evidence global measures of cognition are associated with serious fall-related injury, though there is no consensus on threshold values. Executive function was also associated with increased risk, which supports its inclusion in fall risk assessment especially when global measures are within normal limits.

**Abstract:**
Among healthy older adults, individuals with poorer EF are more prone to falls. Higher-level cognitive functions such as those regulated by the frontal lobes are apparently needed for safe everyday navigation that demands multitasking. Optimal screening, early detection, and treatment of falls should, apparently, also target this cognitive domain.

**Abstract:**
Earlier autism diagnosis, the importance of early intervention, and development of specific interventions for young children have contributed to the emergence of similar, empirically supported, autism interventions that represent the merging of applied behavioral and developmental sciences. "Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI)" are implemented in natural settings, involve shared control between child and therapist, utilize natural contingencies, and use a variety of behavioral strategies to teach developmentally appropriate and prerequisite skills. We describe the development of NDBIs, their theoretical bases, empirical support, requisite characteristics, common features, and suggest future research needs. We wish to bring parsimony to a field that includes interventions with different names but common features thus improving understanding and choice-making among families, service providers and referring agencies.

**Abstract:**
These findings demonstrate that among community-living older adults, the risk of future falls was predicted by performance on EF and attention tests conducted 5 years earlier. The present results link falls among older adults to cognition, indicating that screening EF will likely enhance fall risk assessment, and that treatment of EF may reduce fall risk.

**Abstract:**
Most people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) fall and many experience recurrent falls. The aim of this review was to examine the scope of recurrent falls and to identify factors associated with recurrent fallers. A database search for journal articles which reported prospectively collected information concerning recurrent falls in people with PD identified 22 studies. In these studies, 60.5% (range 35 to 90%) of participants reported at least one fall, with 39% (range 18 to 65%) reporting recurrent falls. Recurrent fallers reported an average of 4.7 to 67.6 falls per person per year (overall average 20.8 falls). Factors associated with recurrent falls include: a positive fall history, increased disease severity and duration, increased motor impairment, treatment with dopamine agonists, increased levodopa dosage, cognitive impairment, fear of falling, freezing of gait, impaired mobility and reduced physical activity. The wide range in the frequency of recurrent falls experienced by people with PD suggests that it would be beneficial to classify recurrent fallers into sub-groups based on fall frequency. Given that there are several factors particularly associated with recurrent falls, fall management and prevention strategies specifically targeting recurrent fallers require urgent evaluation in order to inform clinical practice.

**Abstract:**
For over two decades, the Concussion in Sport Group has held meetings and developed five international statements on concussion in sport. This 6th statement summarises the processes and outcomes of the 6th International Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Amsterdam on 27–30 October 2022 and should be read in conjunction with the (1) methodology paper that outlines the consensus process in detail and (2) 10 systematic reviews that informed the conference outcomes. Over 3½ years, author groups conducted systematic reviews of predetermined priority topics relevant to concussion in sport. The format of the conference, expert panel meetings and workshops to revise or develop new clinical assessment tools, as described in the methodology paper, evolved from previous consensus meetings with several new components. Apart from this consensus statement, the conference process yielded revised tools including the Concussion Recognition Tool-6 (CRT6) and Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-6 (SCAT6, Child SCAT6), as well as a new tool, the Sport Concussion Office Assessment Tool-6 (SCOAT6, Child SCOAT6). This consensus process also integrated new features including a focus on the para athlete, the athlete’s perspective, concussion-specific medical ethics and matters related to both athlete retirement and the potential long-term effects of SRC, including neurodegenerative disease. This statement summarises evidence-informed principles of concussion prevention, assessment and management, and emphasises those areas requiring more research.

**Abstract:**
Lateral ankle sprains (LASs) are among the most common injuries incurred during participation in sport and physical activity, and it is estimated that up to 40% of individuals who experience a first-time LAS will develop chronic ankle instability (CAI). Chronic ankle instability is characterized by a patient's being more than 12 months removed from the initial LAS and exhibiting a propensity for recurrent ankle sprains, frequent episodes or perceptions of the ankle giving way, and persistent symptoms such as pain, swelling, limited motion, weakness, and diminished self-reported function. We present an updated model of CAI that aims to synthesize the current understanding of its causes and serves as a framework for the clinical assessment and rehabilitation of patients with LASs or CAI. Our goal was to describe how primary injury to the lateral ankle ligaments from an acute LAS may lead to a collection of interrelated pathomechanical, sensory-perceptual, and motor-behavioral impairments that influence a patient's clinical outcome. With an underpinning of the biopsychosocial model, the concepts of self-organization and perception-action cycles derived from dynamic systems theory and a patient-specific neurosignature, stemming from the Melzack neuromatrix of pain theory, are used to describe these interrelationships.

**Abstract:**
Background and Purpose- Functional community ambulation requires the ability to perform mobility and cognitive task simultaneously (dual-tasking). This single-blinded randomized controlled study aimed to examine the effects of dual-task exercise in chronic stroke patients. Methods- Eighty-four chronic stroke patients (24 women; age, 61.2±6.4 years; time since stroke onset, 75.3±64.9 months) with mild to moderate motor impairment (Chedoke-McMaster leg motor score: median, 5; interquartile range, 4-6) were randomly allocated to the dual-task balance/mobility training group, single-task balance/mobility group, or upper-limb exercise (control) group. Each group exercised for three 60-minute sessions per week for 8 weeks. The dual-task interference effect was measured for the time to completion of 3 mobility tests (forward walking, timed-up-and-go, and obstacle crossing) and for the correct response rate during serial-3-subtractions and verbal fluency task. Secondary outcomes included the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, Frenchay Activities Index, and Stroke-specific Quality of Life Scale. The above outcomes were measured at baseline, immediately after, and 8 weeks after training. Fall incidence was recorded for a 6-month period posttraining. Results- Only the dual-task group exhibited reduced dual-task interference in walking time posttraining (forward walking combined with verbal fluency [9.5%, P=0.014], forward walking with serial-3-subtractions [9.6%, P=0.035], and the timed-up-and-go with verbal fluency [16.8%, P=0.001]). The improvements in dual-task walking were largely maintained at the 8-week follow-up. The dual-task cognitive performance showed no significant changes. The dual-task program reduced the risk of falls and injurious falls by 25.0% (95% CI, 3.1%-46.9%; P=0.037) and 22.2% (95% CI, 4.0%-38.4%; P=0.023), respectively, during the 6-month follow-up period compared with controls. There was no significant effect on other secondary outcomes ( P>0.05). Conclusions- The dual-task program was effective in improving dual-task mobility, reducing falls and fall-related injuries in ambulatory chronic stroke patients with intact cognition. It had no significant effect on activity participation or quality of life. Clinical trial registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov . Unique identifier: NCT02270398.

**Abstract:**
Older adults have a decreased trunk movement control which is linked to their higher fall risk. While motor/cognitive dual-tasking deteriorates balance and walking in older adults, there is limited understanding on how trunk kinematics and kinetics are affected by dual-tasking in scenarios where falls can occur. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to determine the impacts of a challenging motor dual-task, specifically obstacle avoidance during walking, on trunk and lower-body kinematics and kinetics of older adults compared to young adults. The study captured three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data from 12 young adults and 10 older adults as they walked on a treadmill and stepped over an obstacle with both legs. The study analyzed trunk, hip, knee, and ankle angles and torques. Trunk torque was further broken down to trunk muscle torque, gravitational torque, and inertia torque. A linear mixed effects model was used to investigate the difference in each variable between the two groups. Older adults exhibited significantly increased trunk flexion angle and trunk extension muscle torque compared to young adults, with the trunk being the only segment/joint showing differences in both kinematics and kinetics. Trunk torque breakdown analysis revealed that larger trunk flexion led to a larger gravitational torque, which contributed to an increased compensatory trunk muscle torque. Moreover, older adults' less controlled trunk flexion during weight shifting from trail leg to the lead leg, necessitated a compensatory trunk deceleration during trail leg obstacle avoidance which was achieved by generating additional increase in trunk muscle torque. The study demonstrated that motor dual-tasking has the most negative effects on trunk control in older adults compared to young adults. This exposes older adults to a higher fall risk. Therefore, future work should focus on supporting trunk control during daily multi-tasking conditions where falls can occur.

**Abstract:**
Gait asymmetry and dynamic balance impairments observed in post-stroke individuals increase their risk of fall. Moreover, walking while performing a cognitive task (i.e. dual-task) disturbs the control of balance in post-stroke individuals. Here we investigated the mediolateral dynamic stability in twenty-two community-dwelling participants (12 post-strokes and 10 healthy controls) while walking in single-task (normal gait) and four different dual-tasks (cognitive-motor interference). Positions of the extrapolated center of mass and mediolateral widths of both margin of stability and base of support were extracted from 35 marker trajectories. Post-stroke participants presented larger margin of stability and base of support than controls during single-task (both p < 0.01), with a larger margin of stability on the non-paretic side than on the paretic side at ipsilateral foot-strike (p < 0.05). No significant effect of the dual-task was found between groups. In post-stroke participants, dual-task induced slight modification of the mediolateral stability strategy, as the margin of stability was not different between the two limbs at foot-strike, and significantly reduced the performance in every cognitive task. Post-stroke participants increased their dynamic stability in the frontal plane in single-task by extending their base of support and mainly relying on their non-paretic limb. Under cognitive-motor interference (dual-task), post-stroke participants prioritized dynamic stability over cognitive performance to ensure a safe locomotion. Thus, rehabilitation programs should consider both dynamic balance and dual-task training, even at a chronic delay following stroke, to reduce the risk of fall in post-stroke individuals.

**Abstract:**
Falls pose a major threat to the well-being and quality of life of older people. Falls can result in fractures and other injuries, disability and fear and can trigger a decline in physical function and loss of autonomy. This article synthesises recent published findings on fall risk and mobility assessments and fall prevention interventions and considers how this field of research may evolve in the future. Fall risk topics include the utility of remote monitoring using wearable sensors and recent work investigating brain activation and gait adaptability. New approaches for exercise for fall prevention including dual-task training, cognitive-motor training with exergames and reactive step training are discussed. Additional fall prevention strategies considered include the prevention of falls in older people with dementia and Parkinson's disease, drugs for fall prevention and safe flooring for preventing fall-related injuries. The review discusses how these new initiatives and technologies have potential for effective fall prevention and improved quality of life. It concludes by emphasising the need for a continued focus on translation of evidence into practice including robust effectiveness evaluations of so that resources can be appropriately targeted into the future.

**Abstract:**
Falling is a frequent and major clinical problem among older adults, as well as in patients with chronic cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). At present, sequential (mixed) and simultaneously (dual-task) motor-cognitive trainings are the best approaches to affording patients more autonomy in their everyday motor independence while reducing fall risks and consequences. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an advanced and innovative dual-task motor-cognitive rehabilitation program on fall risks in vulnerable older persons with chronic CVD. To this purpose, 26 consecutive older fallers with chronic CVD were recruited, and completed a mixed motor-cognitive or a dual-task motor-cognitive training program. Each patient also underwent two test evaluations to assess balance, gait, fear of falling, and walking performance at pre-and post-intervention. We found that our experimental motor-cognitive dual-task rehabilitation program could be an effective method to improve walking balance, gait, walking speed, and fear of falling, while reducing the risk of falls in older people with chronic CVD. Furthermore, results show that the simultaneous motor-cognitive training is more effective than the sequential motor-cognitive training. Therefore, our study brings innovative data, which can contribute positively to the management of this population.

**Abstract:**
Falls and fall-induced injuries are major global public health problems, and sensory input impairment in older adults results in significant limitations in feedback-type postural control. A haptic-based biofeedback (BF) system can be used for augmenting somatosensory input in older adults, and the application of this BF system can increase the objectivity of the feedback and encourage comparison with that provided by a trainer. Nevertheless, an optimal BF system that focuses on interpersonal feedback for balance training in older adults has not been proposed. Thus, we proposed a haptic-based perception-empathy BF system that provides information regarding the older adult's center-of-foot pressure pattern to the trainee and trainer for refining the motor learning effect. The first objective of this study was to examine the effect of this balance training regimen in healthy older adults performing a postural learning task. Second, this study aimed to determine whether BF training required high cognitive load to clarify its practicability in real-life settings. Twenty older adults were assigned to two groups: BF and control groups. Participants in both groups tried balance training in the single-leg stance while performing a cognitive task (i.e., serial subtraction task). Retention was tested 24 h later. Testing comprised balance performance measures (i.e., 95% confidence ellipse area and mean velocity of sway) and dual-task performance (number of responses and correct answers). Measurements of postural control using a force plate revealed that the stability of the single-leg stance was significantly lower in the BF group than in the control group during the balance task. The BF group retained the improvement in the 95% confidence ellipse area 24 h after the retention test. Results of dual-task performance during the balance task were not different between the two groups. These results confirmed the potential benefit of the proposed balance training regimen in designing successful motor learning programs for preventing falls in older adults.

**Abstract:**
With about one third of adults aged 65 years and older being reported worldwide to fall each year, and an even higher prevalence with advancing age, aged-related falls and the associated disabilities and mortality are a major public health concern. In this context, identification of fall risk in healthy older adults is a key component of fall prevention. Since dual-task outcomes rely on the interaction between cognition and motor control, some studies have demonstrated the role of dual-task walking performance or costs in predicting future fallers. However, based on previous reviews on the topic, (1) discriminative and (2) predictive powers of dual tasks involving gait and a concurrent task are still a matter of debate, as is (3) their superiority over single tasks in terms of fall-risk prediction. Moreover, less attention has been paid to dual tasks involving postural control and transfers (such as gait initiation and turns) as motor tasks. In the present paper, we therefore systematically reviewed recent literature over the last 7 years in order to answer the three above mentioned questions regarding the future of lab-based dual tasks (involving posture, gait initiation, gait and turning) as easily applicable tests for identifying healthy older adult fallers. Despite great heterogeneity among included studies, we emphasized, among other things, the promising added value of dual tasks including turns and other transfers, such as in the Timed Up and Go test, for prediction of falls. Further investigation of these is thus warranted.

**Abstract:**
Injury due to falls is a major problem among older adults. Decrements in dual-task postural control performance (simultaneously performing two tasks, at least one of which requires postural control) have been associated with an increased risk of falling. Evidence-based interventions that can be used in clinical or community settings to improve dual-task postural control may help to reduce this risk.

**Abstract:**
This study examined transfer effects of fall training on fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale-International [FES-I]), balance performance, and spatiotemporal gait characteristics in older adults. Eighteen community-dwelling older adults (ages 65-85) were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention group completed 12 training sessions (60 min, 6 weeks). During pre- and posttesting, we measured FES-I, balance performance (double limb, closed eyes; single limb, open eyes; double limb, open eyes with motor-interfered task), and gait parameters (e.g., velocity; cadence; stride time, stride width, and stride length; variability of stride time and stride length) under single- and motor-interfered tasks. Dual tasks were applied to appraise improvements of cognitive processing during balance and gait. FES-I (p = .33) and postural sway did not significantly change (0.36 < p < .79). Trends toward significant interaction effects were found for step width during normal walking and stride length variability during the motor dual task (p = .05, ηp 2 = .22). Fall training did not sufficiently improve fear of falling, balance, or gait performance under single- or dual-task conditions in healthy older adults.

**Abstract:**
Aging entails concurrent declines in physical and cognitive domains, contributing to reduced independence, higher fall risk, and lower quality of life. Understanding how motor performance relates to cognition is crucial for prevention in community-dwelling older adults. This cross-sectional study investigated associations between physical fitness-including strength, endurance, balance, and aerobic capacity-and cognitive outcomes assessed by Trail Making Tests (TMT-A, TMT-B), the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and dual-task cost in the Timed Up & Go Test (TUG_DTC). Thirty-four sedentary but cognitively healthy adults aged ≥60 years were evaluated. Quadriceps strength was significantly related to TUG_DTC and executive function (TMT-B), while upper-limb endurance correlated with both attentional and executive measures. Dynamic balance, particularly in posterior directions, was linked to DSST and TMT-B, and 6-min walk test performance was associated with executive functioning and processing speed. TUG_DTC itself showed strong correlations with cognitive outcomes, underscoring its sensitivity to motor-cognitive interference. These findings highlight selective motor-cognitive relationships and suggest that simple, field-based tests may serve as early markers of cognitive vulnerability. Targeting lower-limb strength, balance, and aerobic capacity could represent cost-effective strategies to promote mobility and cognitive resilience in aging populations.
