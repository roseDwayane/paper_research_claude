      "abstract": "Two key characteristics of all virtual reality applications are interaction and immersion. Systemic interaction is achieved through a variety of multisensory channels (hearing, sight, touch, and smell), permitting the user to interact with the virtual world in real time. Immersion is the degree to which a person can feel wrapped in the virtual world through a defined interface. Virtual reality interface devices such as the NintendoÂ® Wii and its peripheral nunchuks-balance board, head mounted displays and joystick allow interaction and immersion in unreal environments created from computer software. Virtual environments are highly interactive, generating great activation of visual, vestibular and proprioceptive systems during the execution of a video game. In addition, they are entertaining and safe for the user. Recently, incorporating therapeutic purposes in virtual reality interface devices has allowed them to be used for the rehabilitation of neurological patients, e.g., balance training in older adults and dynamic stability in healthy participants. The improvements observed in neurological diseases (chronic stroke and cerebral palsy) have been shown by changes in the reorganization of neural networks in patientsâ brain, along with better hand function and other skills, contributing to their quality of life. The data generated by such studies could substantially contribute to physical rehabilitation strategies.",

      "abstract": "An instrument for remote control of the robot by wearable brain-computer interface (BCI) is proposed for rehabilitating children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Augmented reality (AR) glasses generate flickering stimuli, and a single-channel electroencephalographic BCI detects the elicited steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs). This allows benefiting from the SSVEP robustness by leaving available the view of robot movements. Together with the lack of training, a single channel maximizes the device's wearability, fundamental for the acceptance by ADHD children. Effectively controlling the movements of a robot through a new channel enhances rehabilitation engagement and effectiveness. A case study at an accredited rehabilitation center on ten healthy adult subjects highlighted an average accuracy higher than 83%, with information transfer rate (ITR) up to 39 b/min. Preliminary further tests on four ADHD patients between six- and eight-years old provided highly positive feedback on device acceptance and attentional performance.",

      "abstract": "Stroke is one of the leading causes of permanent disability in adults. The literature suggests that rehabilitation is key to early motor recovery. However, conventional therapy is labor and cost intensive. Robotic and functional electrical stimulation (FES) devices can provide a high dose of repetitions and as such may provide an alternative, or an adjunct, to conventional rehabilitation therapy. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) could augment neuroplasticity by introducing mental training. However, mental training alone is not enough; but combining mental with physical training could boost outcomes. In the current case study, a portable rehabilitative platform and goal-oriented supporting training protocols were introduced and tested with a chronic stroke participant. A novel training method was introduced with the proposed rehabilitative platform. A 37-year old individual with chronic stroke participated in 6-weeks of training (18 sessions in total, 3 sessions a week, and 1 h per session). In this case study, we show that an individual with chronic stroke can tolerate a 6-week training bout with our system and protocol. The participant was actively engaged throughout the training. Changes in the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) suggest that the training positively affected arm motor function (12% improvement in WMFT score).",

      "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this review was to identify how conversational agents are designed and used in rehabilitation for adults with brain-related neurological conditions. Introduction: Adults with brain-related neurological conditions experience varied cognitive and functional challenges that can persist long term. However, rehabilitation services are time- and resource-limited, and novel rehabilitation approaches are warranted. Conversational agents provide a human–computer interface with which the user can converse. A conversational agent can be designed to meet specific user needs, such as rehabilitation and support. Inclusion criteria: Studies focused on the design and use of conversational agents for rehabilitation for people aged 18 years or older with brain-related neurological conditions were considered for inclusion. Eligible publication types included peer-reviewed publications (quantitative, qualitative, and/or mixed methods study designs; research protocols; peer-reviewed expert opinion papers; clinical studies, including pilot trials; systematic or scoping reviews), full conference papers, and master’s or PhD theses. Eligible types of research included prototype development, feasibility testing, and clinical trials. Methods: Online databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest (all databases), Web of Science, and gray literature sources were searched with no date limit. Only English publications were considered due to a lack of resourcing available for translations. Title and abstract screening and full-text review were conducted by two independent reviewers. Data extraction was shared by three independent reviewers. The data extraction instrument was iteratively refined to meet the requirements of all included papers, and covered details for technological aspects and the clinical context. Results are presented narratively and in tabular format, with emphasis on participants, concept and context, and data extraction instrument components. Results: Eleven papers were included in the review, which represented seven distinct conversational agent prototypes. Methodologies included technology description (n = 9) and initial user testing (n = 6). The intended clinical cohorts for the reported conversational agents were people with dementia (n = 5), Parkinson disease (n = 2), stroke (n = 1), traumatic brain injury (n = 1), mixed dementia and mild cognitive impairment (n = 1), and mixed dementia and Parkinson disease (n = 1). Two studies included participants who were healthy or otherwise from the general community. The design of the conversational agents considered technology aspects and clinical purposes. Two conversational agent prototypes incorporated a speaking humanoid avatar as reported in five of the papers. Topics of conversation focused on subjects enjoyable to the user (life history, hobbies, where they lived). The clinical purposes reported in the 11 papers were to increase the amount of conversation the user has each day (n = 4), reminiscence (n = 2), and one study each for anxiety management and education, Parkinson disease education, to obtain and analyze a recording of the user’s voice, to monitor well-being, and to build rapport before providing daily task prompts. One study reported clinician oversight of the conversational agent use. The studies had low sample sizes (range: 1–33). No studies undertook effectiveness testing. Outcome measures focused on usability, language detection and production, and technological performance. No health-related outcomes were measured. No adverse events were reported, and only two studies reported safety considerations. Conclusions: Current literature reporting the design and use of conversational agents for rehabilitation for adults with brain-related neurological conditions is heterogeneous and represents early stages of conversational agent development and testing. We recommend, as per our customized data extraction instrument, that studies of conversational agents for this population clearly define technical aspects, methodology for developing the conversation content, recruitment methods, safety issues, and requirements for clinician oversight.",

      "abstract": "Background The aging of the world population poses a major health challenge, and brain–computer interface (BCI) technology has the potential to provide assistance and rehabilitation for the elderly. Objectives This study aimed to investigate the electroencephalogram (EEG) characteristics during motor imagery by comparing young and elderly, and study Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) classification for the elderly population in terms of fatigue analysis in both frontal and parietal regions. Methods A total of 20 healthy individuals participated in the study, including 10 young and 10 older adults. All participants completed the left- and right-hand motor imagery experiment. The energy changes in the motor imagery process were analyzed using time–frequency graphs and quantified event-related desynchronization (ERD) values. The fatigue level of the motor imagery was assessed by two indicators: (θ + α)/β and θ/β, and fatigue-sensitive channels were distinguished from the parietal region of the brain. Then, rhythm entropy was introduced to analyze the complexity of the cognitive activity. The phase-lock values related to the parietal and frontal lobes were calculated, and their temporal synchronization was discussed. Finally, the motor imagery EEG data was classified by CNNs, and the accuracy was discussed based on the analysis results. Result For the young and elderly, ERD was observed in C3 and C4 channels, and their fatigue-sensitive channels in the parietal region were slightly different. During the experiment, the rhythm entropy of the frontal lobe showed a decreasing trend with time for most of the young subjects, while there was an increasing trend for most of the older ones. Using the CNN classification method, the elderly achieved around 70% of the average classification accuracy, which is almost the same for the young adults. Conclusion Compared with the young adults, the elderly are less affected by the level of cognitive fatigue during motor imagery, but the classification accuracy of motor imagery data in the elderly may be slightly lower than that in young persons. At the same time, the deep learning method also provides a potentially feasible option for the application of motor-imagery BCI (MI-BCI) in the elderly by considering the ERD and fatigue phenomenon together.",

We conducted a systematic overview of best available evidence (2012–2019), appraising evidence using GRADE and the Evidence Alert Traffic Light System and then aggregated the new findings with our previous 2013 findings. This article summarizes the best available evidence interventions for preventing and managing cerebral palsy in 2019. Recent Findings Effective prevention strategies include antenatal corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, caffeine, and neonatal hypothermia. Effective allied health interventions include acceptance and commitment therapy, action observations, bimanual training, casting, constraint-induced movement therapy, environmental enrichment, fitness training, goal-directed training, hippotherapy, home programs, literacy interventions, mobility training, oral sensorimotor, oral sensorimotor plus electrical stimulation, pressure care, stepping stones triple P, strength training, task-specific training, treadmill training, partial body weight support treadmill training, and weight-bearing. Effective medical and surgical interventions include anti-convulsants, bisphosphonates, botulinum toxin, botulinum toxin plus occupational therapy, botulinum toxin plus casting, diazepam, dentistry, hip surveillance, intrathecal baclofen, scoliosis correction, selective dorsal rhizotomy, and umbilical cord blood cell therapy. Summary We have provided guidance about what works and what does not to inform decision-making, and highlighted areas for more research.",

Despite advancements in VR technologies, many users still experience sickness symptoms. VR sickness may be influenced by technological differences within HMDs such as resolution and refresh rate, however, VR content also plays a significant role. The primary objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the literature on HMDs that report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) scores to determine the impact of content. User factors associated with VR sickness were also examined. A systematic search was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Fifty-five articles met inclusion criteria, representing 3,016 participants (mean age range 19.5-80; 41% female). Findings show gaming content recorded the highest total SSQ mean 34.26 (95%CI 29.57-38.95). VR sickness profiles were also influenced by visual stimulation, locomotion and exposure times. Older samples (mean age ≥35 years) scored significantly lower total SSQ means than younger samples, however, these findings are based on a small evidence base as a limited number of studies included older users. No sex differences were found. Across all types of content, the pooled total SSQ mean was relatively high 28.00 (95%CI 24.66-31.35) compared with recommended SSQ cut-off scores. These findings are of relevance for informing future research and the application of VR in different contexts.",

We discuss what the adaptive and engaging virtual environments can provide for massive and intensive sensorimotor stimulation needed to induce brain reorganization.Second, discrepancies between the veridical and virtual feedback can be introduced in VR to facilitate activation of targeted brain networks, which in turn can potentially speed up the recovery process. Here we review the existing experimental evidence regarding the beneficial effects of training in virtual environments on the recovery of function in the areas of gait,upper extremity function and balance, in various patient populations. We also discuss possible mechanisms underlying these effects. We feel that future research in the area of virtual rehabilitation should follow several important paths. Imaging studies to evaluate the effects of sensory manipulation on brain activation patterns and the effect of various training parameters on long term changes in brain function are needed to guide future clinical inquiry. Larger clinical studies are also needed to establish the efficacy of sensorimotor rehabilitation using VR in various clinical populations and most importantly, to identify VR training parameters that are associated with optimal transfer to real-world functional improvements.",

      "abstract": "Background With the rise of mobile medicine, the development of new technologies such as smart sensing, and the popularization of personalized health concepts, the field of smart wearable devices has developed rapidly in recent years. Among them, medical wearable devices have become one of the most promising fields. These intelligent devices not only assist people in pursuing a healthier lifestyle but also provide a constant stream of health care data for disease diagnosis and treatment by actively recording physiological parameters and tracking metabolic status. Therefore, wearable medical devices have the potential to become a mainstay of the future mobile medical market. Objective Although previous reviews have discussed consumer trends in wearable electronics and the application of wearable technology in recreational and sporting activities, data on broad clinical usefulness are lacking. We aimed to review the current application of wearable devices in health care while highlighting shortcomings for further research. In addition to daily health and safety monitoring, the focus of our work was mainly on the use of wearable devices in clinical practice. Methods We conducted a narrative review of the use of wearable devices in health care settings by searching papers in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library published since October 2015. Potentially relevant papers were then compared to determine their relevance and reviewed independently for inclusion. Results A total of 82 relevant papers drawn from 960 papers on the subject of wearable devices in health care settings were qualitatively analyzed, and the information was synthesized. Our review shows that the wearable medical devices developed so far have been designed for use on all parts of the human body, including the head, limbs, and torso. These devices can be classified into 4 application areas: (1) health and safety monitoring, (2) chronic disease management, (3) disease diagnosis and treatment, and (4) rehabilitation. However, the wearable medical device industry currently faces several important limitations that prevent further use of wearable technology in medical practice, such as difficulties in achieving user-friendly solutions, security and privacy concerns, the lack of industry standards, and various technical bottlenecks. Conclusions We predict that with the development of science and technology and the popularization of personalized health concepts, wearable devices will play a greater role in the field of health care and become better integrated into people’s daily lives. However, more research is needed to explore further applications of wearable devices in the medical field. We hope that this review can provide a useful reference for the development of wearable medical devices.",

There are many surveys in the field of digital serious games; however, most surveys are specific to a particular area such as education or health. So far, there has been little work done to survey digital serious games in general, which is the main goal of this paper. Hence, we discuss relevant work on serious games in different application areas including education, well-being, advertisement, cultural heritage, interpersonal communication, and health care. We also propose a taxonomy for digital serious games, and we suggest a classification of reviewed serious games applications from the literature against the defined taxonomy. Finally, the paper provides guidelines, drawn from the literature, for the design and development of successful serious games, as well as discussing research perspectives in this domain.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability among adults and contributes to major socio-economic burden globally. Stroke frequently results in multifaceted impairments including motor, cognitive and emotion deficits. In recent years, brain–computer interface (BCI)-based therapy has shown promising results for post-stroke motor rehabilitation. In spite of the success received by BCI-based interventions in the motor domain, non-motor impairments are yet to receive similar attention in research and clinical settings. Some preliminary encouraging results in post-stroke cognitive rehabilitation using BCI seem to suggest that it may also hold potential for treating non-motor deficits such as cognitive and emotion impairments. Moreover, past studies have shown an intricate relationship between motor, cognitive and emotion functions which might influence the overall post-stroke rehabilitation outcome. A number of studies highlight the inability of current treatment protocols to account for the implicit interplay between motor, cognitive and emotion functions. This indicates the necessity to explore an all-inclusive treatment plan targeting the synergistic influence of these standalone interventions. This approach may lead to better overall recovery than treating the individual deficits in isolation. In this paper, we review the recent advances in BCI-based post-stroke motor rehabilitation and highlight the potential for the use of BCI systems beyond the motor domain, in particular, in improving cognition and emotion of stroke patients. Building on the current results and findings of studies in individual domains, we next discuss the possibility of a holistic BCI system for motor, cognitive and affect rehabilitation which may synergistically promote restorative neuroplasticity. Such a system would provide an all-encompassing rehabilitation platform, leading to overarching clinical outcomes and transfer of these outcomes to a better quality of living. This is one of the first works to analyse the possibility of targeting cross-domain influence of post-stroke functional recovery enabled by BCI-based rehabilitation.",

In this review, the typical products and prototypes of lower limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robots are introduced and state-of-the-art techniques are analyzed and summarized. Because the goal of rehabilitation training is to recover patients’ sporting ability to the normal level, studying the human gait is the foundation of lower limb exoskeleton rehabilitation robot research. Therefore, this review critically evaluates research progress in human gait analysis and systematically summarizes developments in the mechanical design and control of lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton robots. From the performance of typical prototypes, it can be deduced that these robots can be connected to human limbs as wearable forms; further, it is possible to control robot movement at each joint to simulate normal gait and drive the patient’s limb to realize robot-assisted rehabilitation training. Therefore human–robot integration is one of the most important research directions, and in this context, rigid-flexible-soft hybrid structure design, customized personalized gait generation, and multimodal information fusion are three key technologies.",

      "abstract": "In the United States, there are over seven million stroke survivors, with many facing gait impairments due to foot drop. This restricts their community ambulation and hinders functional independence, leading to several long-term health complications. Despite the best available physical therapy, gait function is incompletely recovered, and this occurs mainly during the acute phase post-stroke. Therapeutic options are limited currently. Novel therapies based on neurobiological principles have the potential to lead to long-term functional improvements. The Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) system is one such strategy. It is based on Hebbian principles and has shown promise in early feasibility studies. The current study describes the BCI-FES clinical trial, which examines the safety and efficacy of this system, compared to conventional physical therapy (PT), to improve gait velocity for those with chronic gait impairment post-stroke. The trial also aims to find other secondary factors that may impact or accompany these improvements and establish the potential of Hebbian-based rehabilitation therapies.",

Through comparative neuroactivation analysis of 17 normal controls and 13 ICH patients during MI tasks, the transfer learning model achieved 74.87% mean classification accuracy on patient data when trained with optimally selected normal templates. Cross-validation on two public hybrid EEG-fNIRS datasets demonstrated generalizability, increasing baseline accuracy to 82.30% and 87.24%, respectively. The proposed system synergistically combines the millisecond temporal resolution of EEG with the hemodynamic spatial specificity of fNIRS, establishing the first clinically viable multimodal analytical protocol for ICH rehabilitation. This paradigm advances neurotechnology translation by paving the way for personalized rehabilitation regimens through robust cross-subject neural pattern transfer while addressing the critical barrier of neurophysiological heterogeneity in post-ICH populations.",

We report on 7 years of independent at-home use of an implanted brain-computer interface for communication by a person with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the inception of which was reported in 2016. The frequency of at-home use increased over time to compensate for gradual loss of control of an eye-gaze-tracking device, followed by a progressive decrease in use starting 6 years after implantation. At-home use ended when control of the brain-computer interface became unreliable. No signs of technical malfunction were found. Instead, the amplitude of neural signals declined, and computed tomographic imaging revealed progressive atrophy, which suggested that ALS-related neurodegeneration ultimately rendered the brain-computer interface ineffective after years of successful use, although alternative explanations are plausible.

Here we show that BCI coupled to functional electrical stimulation (FES) elicits significant, clinically relevant, and lasting motor recovery in chronic stroke survivors more effectively than sham FES. Such recovery is associated to quantitative signatures of functional neuroplasticity. BCI patients exhibit a significant functional recovery after the intervention, which remains 6-12 months after the end of therapy. Electroencephalography analysis pinpoints significant differences in favor of the BCI group, mainly consisting in an increase in functional connectivity between motor areas in the affected hemisphere. This increase is significantly correlated with functional improvement. Results illustrate how a BCI-FES therapy can drive significant functional recovery and purposeful plasticity thanks to contingent activation of body natural efferent and afferent pathways.",

We evaluated the effectiveness of this BCI-robot system using the Berlin Bimanual Test for Stroke (BeBiTS), a set of 10 daily living tasks involving both hands. Eight stroke patients participated in this study, but only four participants could adapt to the BCI robot system training and perform the postBeBiTS. Notably, when the preBeBiTS score for each item was four or less, the BCI robot system showed greater assistive effectiveness in the postBeBiTS assessment. Furthermore, our current robotic hand does not assist with arm and wrist functions, limiting its use in tasks requiring complex hand movements. More participants are required to confirm the training effectiveness of the BCI-robot system, and future research should consider using robots that can assist with a broader range of upper limb functions.

Current systems rely on static visual representations for patients to perform motor imagination (MI) tasks, resulting in lower BCI performance. Therefore, this study innovatively used MI and high-frequency steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to construct a friendly and natural hybrid BCI paradigm. Specifically, the stimulation interface sequentially presented decomposed action pictures of the left and right hands gripping a ball, with the pictures flashing at specific stimulation frequencies (left: 34 Hz, right: 35 Hz). Integrating soft robotic glove as feedback, we established a comprehensive \"peripheral - central - peripheral\" hand rehabilitation system to facilitate the hand rehabilitation of patients. Filter bank common spatial pattern (FBCSP) and filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) algorithms were used to identify MI and SSVEP signals, respectively. Additionally, we proposed a novel fusion algorithm to decide the final output of the system. The feasibility of the proposed system was validated through online experiments involving 12 healthy subjects and 9 stroke patients, achieving accuracy rates of 95.83 ± 6.83% and 63.33 ± 10.38, respectively. The accuracy of MI and SSVEP in 12 healthy subjects reached 81.67 ± 15.63% and 95.14 ± 7.47%, both lower than the accuracy after fusion, these results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The accuracy rate was more than 50% in both healthy subjects and patients, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

This approach has been demonstrated to facilitate corticospinal excitability and functional recovery in patients with lower limb weakness following stroke. The current study expands those findings by investigating changes in corticospinal excitability following the associative BCI intervention in patients with post stroke with upper limb weakness. In a randomized controlled trial, 24 patients with subacute stroke, subdivided into an intervention group and a \"sham\" control group, performed 30 wrist extensions. The intervention comprised 30 pairings of single peripheral nerve stimulation at the motor threshold, timed so that the generated afferent volley arrived at the motor cortex during the peak negativity of the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP), which was identified with EEG. The sham group underwent the same intervention, though the intensity of the nerve stimulation was below the perception threshold. Immediately after training, patients in the associative group exhibited significantly larger amplitudes of muscular-evoked potentials, compared with pretraining measurements in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation. These changes persisted for at least 30 min and were not observed in the sham group. We demonstrate that motor-evoked potential amplitudes increased significantly following paired associative BCI training targeting upper limb muscles in patients with subacute stroke, which is in line with results from lower limb studies.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates whether the combined effect of kinesthetic motor imagery-based brain computer interface (KI-BCI) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on upper limb function in subacute stroke patients is more effective than using KI-BCI or tDCS alone. Forty-eight subacute stroke survivors were randomized to the KI-BCI, tDCS, or BCI-tDCS group. The KI-BCI group performed 30 min of KI-BCI training. Patients in tDCS group received 30 min of tDCS. Patients in BCI-tDCS group received 15 min of tDCS and 15 min of KI-BCI. The treatment cycle was five times a week, for four weeks. After all intervention, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity, Motor Status Scale, and the Modified Barthel Index scores of the KI-BCI group were superior to those of the tDCS group. The BCI-tDCS group was superior to the tDCS group in terms of the Motor Status Scale. Although quantitative EEG showed no significant group differences, the quantitative EEG indices in the tDCS group were significantly lower than before treatment. In conclusion, after treatment, although all intervention strategies improved upper limb motor function and daily living abilities in subacute stroke patients, KI-BCI demonstrated significantly better efficacy than tDCS. Under the same total treatment duration, the combined use of tDCS and KI-BCI did not achieve the hypothesized optimal outcome. Notably, tDCS reduced QEEG indices, possibly indicating favorable future outcomes in future.Trial registry number: ChiCTR2000034730.",

      "abstract": "Motor imagery (MI) based brain computer interface (BCI) has been extensively studied to improve motor recovery for stroke patients by inducing neuroplasticity. However, due to the lower spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of electroencephalograph (EEG), MI based BCI system that involves decoding hand movements within the same limb remains lower classification accuracy and poorer practicality. To overcome the limitations, an adaptive hybrid BCI system combining MI and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) is developed to improve decoding accuracy while enhancing neural engagement. On the one hand, the SSVEP evoked by visual stimuli based on action-state flickering coding approach significantly improves the recognition accuracy compared to the pure MI based BCI. On the other hand, to reduce the impact of SSVEP on MI due to the dual-task interference effect, the event-related desynchronization (ERD) based neural engagement is monitored and employed for feedback in real-time to ensure the effective execution of MI tasks. Eight healthy subjects and six post-stroke patients were recruited to verify the effectiveness of the system. The results showed that the four-class gesture recognition accuracies of healthy individuals and patients could be improved to 94.37 ± 4.77 % and 79.38 ± 6.26 %, respectively. Moreover, the designed hybrid BCI could maintain the same degree of neural engagement as observed when subjects solely performed MI tasks. These phenomena demonstrated the interactivity and clinical utility of the developed system for the rehabilitation of hand function in stroke patients.",

Although important in rehabilitation perspective, the use of corticomuscular coupling for driving brain-computer interface (BCI)-based neurorehabilitation is much ignored.

Hebbian plasticity depends on temporally coinciding pre- and post-synaptic activity. A tight temporal relationship between motor cortical (MC) activity associated with attempted movement and FES-generated visuo-proprioceptive feedback is hypothesized to enhance motor recovery. Using a brain-computer interface (BCI) to classify MC spectral power in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to trigger FES-delivery with detection of movement attempts improved motor outcomes in chronic stroke patients. We hypothesized that heightened neural plasticity earlier post-stroke would further enhance corticomuscular functional connectivity and motor recovery. We compared subcortical non-dominant hemisphere stroke patients in BCI-FES and Random-FES (FES temporally independent of MC movement attempt detection) groups. The primary outcome measure was the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Upper Extremity (FMA-UE). We recorded high-density EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials before and after treatment. The BCI group showed greater: FMA-UE improvement; motor evoked potential amplitude; beta oscillatory power and long-range temporal correlation reduction over contralateral MC; and corticomuscular coherence with contralateral MC. These changes are consistent with enhanced post-stroke motor improvement when movement is synchronized with MC activity reflecting attempted movement.",
