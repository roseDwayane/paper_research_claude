## Identified Research Gaps

### GAP_001: No Gamified EEG-BCI Studies for Balance in Community-Dwelling Older Adults

**Severity:** CRITICAL | **Novelty Potential:** HIGH

**Description:** Despite extensive research on (1) EEG neurofeedback for cognitive enhancement, (2) gamification for engagement in cognitive training, and (3) dual-task training for balance, **no studies have combined all three elements** (gamified + EEG-BCI + balance outcomes) specifically in community-dwelling older adults aged 60+.

- EEG-BCI studies predominantly focus on stroke or clinical populations
- Gamification studies use computerized tasks without neurophysiological feedback
- Balance training studies employ behavioral dual-task paradigms, not BCI

**Evidence Papers:** P1_S1, P2_S1, P3_S1, P1_S3, P2_S3, P16_S3, P1_S4, P11_S4

---

### GAP_002: Transfer Effects from Neurofeedback to Balance/Postural Control Unexplored

**Severity:** CRITICAL | **Novelty Potential:** HIGH

**Description:** While evidence exists for cognitive-to-cognitive transfer and limited cognitive-to-ADL transfer, **the specific transfer pathway from neurofeedback/BCI-based cognitive training to balance and postural control outcomes has not been empirically tested.**

- P28_S5 and P52_S5 demonstrate cognitive training can attenuate physical decline
- But neurofeedback-specific transfer to balance is absent from the literature
- Understanding these transfer mechanisms is essential for efficient training paradigms

**Evidence Papers:** P28_S5, P52_S5, P55_S5, P5_S5, P20_S1, P2_S1

---

### GAP_003: Feasibility of EEG-Based Training in Community Settings Unestablished

**Severity:** MODERATE | **Novelty Potential:** MEDIUM

**Description:** Most neurofeedback studies are conducted in laboratory settings with young or clinical populations. **Feasibility, acceptability, and user experience of EEG-based training for community-dwelling older adults in real-world settings remains poorly characterized.**

- P27_S1 discusses portable monitoring technology potential
- P4_S3 addresses DIY gamified training but in Parkinson's disease
- Engagement and adherence challenges (P32_S3) must be addressed before clinical translation

**Evidence Papers:** P1_S1, P27_S1, P4_S3, P32_S3, P12_S1

## Hypothesis Specification

### Problem Statement
Community-dwelling older adults aged 60+ are at risk for cognitive decline and falls, yet interventions that simultaneously address both domains through engaging, technology-based approaches are lacking. EEG-based neurofeedback shows promise for cognitive enhancement, and gamification can increase engagement, but the feasibility of delivering gamified EEG-BCI training to this population—and whether cognitive gains transfer to balance outcomes—remains unknown.

### Research Questions
- **RQ1:** Is a gamified EEG-based BCI training program feasible and acceptable for community-dwelling older adults aged 60+?
- **RQ2:** Does gamified EEG-BCI training produce improvements in targeted cognitive domains?
- **RQ3:** Do cognitive training effects transfer to balance and postural control outcomes?
- **RQ4:** Does gamification enhance engagement compared to non-gamified training?

### Primary Hypothesis
A gamified EEG-based BCI training program targeting cognitive enhancement is **feasible** for community-dwelling older adults aged 60+, will produce **improvements in attention and executive function**, and these cognitive gains will show **preliminary transfer effects to balance and postural control outcomes**.

### Expected Significance

**Theoretical:** First empirical evidence for cognitive-to-balance transfer via neurofeedback mechanisms; advances understanding of shared neural substrates between cognitive control and postural stability.

**Practical:** Informs design of integrated interventions addressing multiple healthy aging domains; provides feasibility data for future trials and home-based deployment.

### Scope Boundaries

**IN:**
- Community-dwelling older adults aged 60+
- Gamified EEG-based brain-computer interface training
- Cognitive outcome measures (attention, executive function, working memory)
- Balance/postural control outcome measures
- Feasibility and acceptability outcomes

**OUT:**
- Clinical populations (stroke, Parkinson's, dementia)
- Invasive BCI technologies
- Institutionalized older adults
- Definitive efficacy endpoints (feasibility study design)
