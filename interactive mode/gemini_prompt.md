## RESEARCH GAPS TO ADDRESS

### GAP_001: No Gamified EEG-BCI for Balance in Community-Dwelling Older Adults (CRITICAL)

Despite research on (1) EEG neurofeedback for cognition, (2) gamification for engagement, and (3) dual-task training for balance, **no studies combine all three elements** in community-dwelling older adults aged 60+.

- EEG-BCI studies focus on stroke/clinical populations
- Gamification uses computerized tasks without neurophysiological feedback
- Balance training uses behavioral paradigms, not BCI

### GAP_002: Transfer from Neurofeedback to Balance Unexplored (CRITICAL)

While cognitive-to-cognitive and cognitive-to-ADL transfer exists, **transfer from neurofeedback/BCI training specifically to balance and postural control has not been tested**.

### GAP_003: Feasibility of Community-Based EEG Training Unestablished (MODERATE)

Most neurofeedback studies are lab-based with young or clinical populations. **Feasibility for community-dwelling older adults 60+ in real-world settings is unknown**.

---

## HYPOTHESIS & STUDY AIMS

**Problem Statement:** Community-dwelling older adults aged 60+ face risks of cognitive decline and falls, yet engaging technology-based interventions addressing both domains are lacking.

**Hypothesis:** A gamified EEG-based BCI training program is feasible for community-dwelling older adults aged 60+, will improve attention and executive function, and these gains will show preliminary transfer to balance outcomes.

**Study Aims:**
1. Evaluate feasibility and acceptability of gamified EEG-BCI training in older adults
2. Assess preliminary cognitive effects (attention, executive function, working memory)
3. Examine transfer effects to balance and postural control
4. Determine engagement benefits of gamification

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Write the introduction as continuous prose with APA7 in-text citations. Example citation format:

> Neurofeedback enables self-regulation of brain activity through real-time feedback of EEG signals (Marzbani et al., 2016). This approach has shown promise for cognitive enhancement in aging populations (Wang & Hsieh, 2017).

End the introduction with a clear statement of the study aims that addresses all three gaps.
