# Hypothesis Specification

## Research Title
**Cognitive Enhancement and Transfer Effects on Balance in Older Adults: A Feasibility Study of a Gamified EEG-Based BCI**

---

## Scope Definition

### IN (Inclusion Criteria)
- **Population**: Community-dwelling older adults aged 60+
- **Intervention**: Gamified EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) training
- **Cognitive Measures**: Attention, working memory, executive function, processing speed
- **Physical Measures**: Static balance, dynamic balance, postural control, gait parameters
- **Setting**: Community/home-based feasibility
- **Study Type**: Feasibility study with preliminary efficacy outcomes

### OUT (Exclusion Criteria)
- Clinical populations (stroke survivors, Parkinson's disease, dementia)
- Invasive BCI technologies
- Institutionalized older adults
- Adults under 60 years
- Pure cognitive or pure physical training without BCI component
- Laboratory-only protocols without feasibility assessment

---

## Primary Hypothesis

**H1**: A gamified EEG-based BCI training program targeting cognitive enhancement (attention and executive function) is feasible and acceptable for community-dwelling older adults aged 60+.

### Operationalization
- **Feasibility indicators**: Recruitment rate (>70% of target), retention rate (>80%), adherence to protocol (>75% sessions completed), technical usability (System Usability Scale >68)
- **Acceptability indicators**: User satisfaction (>4/5 on Likert scale), qualitative feedback themes

---

## Secondary Hypotheses

**H2**: Participants completing the gamified EEG-BCI training will demonstrate improvements in targeted cognitive domains (attention, executive function, working memory) compared to baseline.

### Operationalization
- Pre-post change in standardized cognitive assessments (e.g., Trail Making Test A/B, Stroop, Digit Span)
- Effect size estimation (Cohen's d)

**H3**: Cognitive training effects will transfer to balance and postural control outcomes in community-dwelling older adults.

### Operationalization
- Pre-post change in balance assessments (e.g., Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go, postural sway measures)
- Correlation between cognitive improvement and balance improvement

**H4**: Gamification elements will enhance engagement and motivation compared to standard neurofeedback protocols.

### Operationalization
- Time-on-task metrics
- Intrinsic Motivation Inventory subscales
- Session completion rates

## Theoretical Framework

### Primary Framework: Cognitive Reserve and Neuroplasticity
- EEG neurofeedback induces neuroplastic changes through operant conditioning of brain rhythms
- Gamification enhances engagement, supporting sustained training necessary for neuroplasticity
- Cognitive reserve built through training may buffer age-related decline

### Secondary Framework: Cognitive-Motor Coupling
- Executive function and attention share neural substrates with postural control (prefrontal-motor networks)
- Training cognitive control may improve resource allocation during balance-challenging situations
- Transfer effects mediated by improved dual-task processing capacity

### Tertiary Framework: Self-Determination Theory (for Gamification)
- Gamification addresses autonomy (choice), competence (challenge-skill balance), and relatedness (social features)
- Intrinsic motivation predicts training adherence and outcomes

## Expected Outcomes

### Primary Outcomes (Feasibility)
1. Recruitment feasibility: ≥70% of approached participants consent
2. Retention: ≥80% complete the study protocol
3. Adherence: ≥75% of training sessions completed
4. Usability: System Usability Scale score ≥68 (above average)
5. Safety: No serious adverse events; <10% minor adverse events (e.g., fatigue)

### Secondary Outcomes (Preliminary Efficacy)
1. Cognitive improvement: Small-to-medium effect sizes (d = 0.3-0.6) on attention and executive function measures
2. Balance transfer: Small effect sizes (d = 0.2-0.4) on balance measures
3. Engagement: Higher time-on-task and completion rates compared to published norms for non-gamified training

## Study Design Recommendations

### Design Type
Single-arm feasibility study with pre-post assessment

### Sample Size
N = 20-30 community-dwelling older adults (typical for feasibility studies; powered for feasibility outcomes, not efficacy)

### Intervention Parameters
- Duration: 8-12 weeks
- Frequency: 2-3 sessions per week
- Session length: 20-30 minutes
- EEG protocol: Theta/beta ratio or alpha enhancement
- Gamification: Points, levels, achievements, progress visualization

### Assessment Schedule
- Baseline (T0): Demographics, cognitive battery, balance assessment, technology acceptance
- Mid-point (T1, week 4-6): Cognitive battery, engagement metrics
- Post-intervention (T2): Full cognitive battery, balance assessment, usability, qualitative interview
- Optional follow-up (T3, 4 weeks post): Retention assessment
